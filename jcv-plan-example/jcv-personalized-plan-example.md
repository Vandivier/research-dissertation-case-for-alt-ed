* take existing credits as exogenous
* enrolled in NOVA, willing to earn alt credit they will accept.
    * CLEP, AP, DISSA, PLA (workforce experience in insurance)
* eventually considering a bachelor's in microbiology or biotechnology, but not doing that rn. maybe a master's later too.
    * strong preference to transfer to NC State...?
* not generally a fan of online learning; very concerned about not learning with physical labs by the bachelor's, wants an internship.
* NOVA associate's degree is Associate's in Science.

  * see degree plan csv for specific course-by-course planning (already done, alternative, or taking at school)
  * NOVA Associate's in Science is specifically made for transfer. See, for example the note on ITE 115. It is assumed the student is targeting a bachelor's degree plan at some other university. Because of ambiguity in NOVA to NC State transfer, there is a significant chance that ITE115 may end up being taken as a wasted class. NC State should be contacted to determine if another class is a better fit. In addition, it's not at all obv
* this plan is technically inefficient from the ROI perspective but it's optimal given preferences
    * I brought up like hey this would be easier from a different university you could do more CLEP, etc, but she wants these institutions arbitrarily
    * I think it would be an error for an advisor not to bring up alternatives (go straight to BS, skip associate, choose different schools), but I don't think it's an error for the advisor to optimize on *informed preferences* (informed in the sense that disclaimer was provided, understood, acknowledged, and then either agreed or dismissed conciously.)
* Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC) is listed as accepting Excelsior credit by exam
    * https://www.excelsior.edu/who-accepts-uexcel-credits
    * From NVCC's point of view, these are likely considered transfer credits https://www.excelsior.edu/exams/transfer-credits
    * Otherwise, NVCC might count them under credit by exam, or as part of a PLACE portfolio review: https://www.nvcc.edu/prior-learning/place.html
    * prepping for the exam might be tricky.
        * Obviously, one can simply take an excelsior course on statistics.
        * there are also official UExcel content guides: https://www.excelsior.edu/exams/get-ready
        * One might also prep for AP Statistics to take the UExcel exam. There are plenty of official and non-official materials for that. Example: https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-statistics/course
        * Finally, Khan Academy is great on stats! However, those classes are ostensibly not aligned to UExcel courses as well as the official guides.
    * of importance to the associate in science degree, Statistics can be taken by UExcel instead of Calculus II in the classroom.
