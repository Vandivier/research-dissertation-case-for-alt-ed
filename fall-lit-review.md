# A Review of the Alternative Education Literature

## 1. Introduction

This research reviews and synthesizes a number of sources as part of an ongoing research effort to assist the understanding and advising of education provision and consumption. The paper is chiefly concerned with the synthesis of the following eight key books, ordered temporally and identified by section:

1. 2008, Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns, Clayton M. Christensen, Curtis W. Johnson, and Michael B. Horn
2. 2011, The Innovative University: Changing the DNA of Higher Education from the Inside Out, Clayton M. Christensen and Henry J. Eyring
3. 2013, College (Un) Bound, Jeffrey Salingo
4. 2014, Blended, Heather Staker and Michael B. Horn
5. March 2015, College Disrupted: The Great Unbundling of Higher Education, Ryan Craig
6. April 2015, Creative Schools: The Grassroots Revolution Thatâ€™s Transforming Education, Ken Robinson
7. Jan 2018, The Case Against Education, Bryan Caplan
8. Sept 2018, A New U: Faster + Cheaper Alternatives to College, Ryan Craig

Other papers are referred to incidentally. This paper adds to existing knowledge in that several of these books have never been reviewed within a journal of economics, and no paper exists which specifically compares and contrasts these books.

A further bit of background information which will prove useful is on the use of certain terms. This information is equally background information and also a result of the synthesis of this literature. The reconciled meaning of these terms assists in creating a standard way to comparatively analyze traditional and alternative modes of education. Due to length, this discussion of terms is provided a dedicated section 

The first section provides the motivation for this paper and describes the organization of this paper. The second section discusses variance in the use of key terms across the literature, then settles the meaning of certain key terms for the purpose of this paper. Each section inclusively between section 3 and section 10 is responsible for reviewing one of the six key books this paper is generally concerned with. The sections are ordered temporally. That is, the same order they were listed above. Temporal ordering was done for conciseness, and also to clarify changes over time. Later work sometimes builds on earlier work, so temporal ordering removes the need for various explanatory asides. Changes over time are specifically summed up in section 10. Section 11 concludes by anticipating future work which may build on this paper.

## 2. Terms

1. traditional/alternative or non-traditional is common but ambiguous
    1. Big Tent alternativism narrowly defines the traditional model and calls alternative everything else; when in doubt, assume this invocation
    2. Small Tent alternativism narrowly defines an alternative model and goes over that; however, there are many such alternative models and even the same term is sometimes used in different ways. So I will sometimes use this invocation, but I will also define terms scoped specifically to this paper.
2. online learning / elearning isn't good enough because universities these days offer fully-online courses
3. alterative/traditional isn't even super clean bc of hybrid models; we need to distinguish between pure traditional, hybrid, and pure alternative; as such it's easy to realize most of the action is in the hybrid space.
4. why do we care about these labels? what is our overall optimization concern? We care about helping people. Notice that the optimal solution immediately varies depending on our goal, and all of these goals have some merit. As such, solutions need to be personalized and individualized. As we will see, the education literature itself repeats this exact point so frequently as to become obvious and foundational to any practitioner. While policy discussions are the furthest from my interest here, I find it interesting to passingly note the deep irony between individualized learning as a foundational requirement and actual public policies, in the US or around the world, implemented or proposed, which invariably contain massive one-size-fits-all implications. As such, any application must first define clear operationalizations for each goal and a clear weighting for each goal to create an optimized action plan:
    1. Getting employed quickly
    2. Getting employed cheaply
    3. Optimizing lifetime earnings
    4. Optimizing education for disadvantaged groups
5. Key difference hinges on public funding, which in turn hinges on formal accredation; so that becomes a nice bright line for alternative/traditional
6. Useful distinction between credential, (education, learning, schooling, pedagogy), and pathway
    1. credential is an artifact issued by a provider to a student which is then presented by the student to others as evidence of skill or knowledge
    2. education is sometimes distinguished from learning. Ken Robinson, for example, says that learning doesn't always result from education. Here, the term education is used to indicate the education system and pedagogical method. This is in direct contrast to a long-running populist distinction which aligns education and learning. Grant allen said 'i have never let my schooling get in the way of my education.' In keeping with this populist distinction, I refer to pedagogy as such or may call it schooling. I consider education equivalent to learning. That is, if the student does not know X, he was in fact not educated about X even if he sat in class during a lecture on X. https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/09/25/schooling-vs-education/
    3. Learning is universally an unambiguously understood to mean that the student has learned about X. While this paper intends to use both learning and education unambiguously, it's useful to know the literature more broadly doesn't do that.
    4. Not sure we need to explain in further detail schooling, or if it can be a discussion on the term group
    5. Not sure we need to explain in further detail pedagogy, or if it can be a discussion on the term group
    6. A pathway refers to the cross-time collection of actions taken to achieve an outcome. It's possible to execute a combination of non-traditional activities to achieve a traditional result and vice versa. Obtaining a 4 year college degree via online classes or credit by examination would be an example of achiveing a traditional credential through an alternative pathway. This concept is interesting because the variety of pathways allow for better personalization and potentially better individual return on investment.

## 3. On Disrupting Class

- go over background
- summarize/review notes
- relate externally and compare/contrast with prior sections (can't really comp/con in this case bc no prior sections)

## Trends over time

- Udacity is our bright-line. Nothing was the same before and after 2011/2012
  - Founded in 2011
  - First online courses launched in 2012
  - First courses for college credit in 2013
  - First formal partnership with university for full-fledged degree in 2014
  - First independent alternative credential, Nanodegree, in 2014
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Udacity&oldid=853136895
  - Udacity may be seen as a microcosm of the entire education movement.
  - Another provider which sheds light is Khan Academy. Their approach is even further embedded within traditional education.
  - Khan recently applied to create a world-recognized secondary credential but didn't get funded; had it gotten funded what would we call it? a traditional or alternative credential? It would have been an innovative approach to obtaining a traditionally accreditted education. It would have been a hybrid. Udacity is essentially market-leading and tightly, although perhaps decreasingly, coupled to IT. Khan Academy is much more mainstream in education and associated with most fields of study and industries of practice. As such, Khan Academy may better represent the state of the average education. This would put the state of the average education in Udacity cerca 2012; you generally cannot obtain college credit through Khan Academy today, although Khan has officially partnered with College Board for SAT and AP prep (as of 2018 or when?), but Khan cannot sponsor a student to take an AP exam or directly obtain credit.

    - Khan founded in 20017; so, roughly, 1 udacity-year is 10 actual years; using a non-serious linear extrapolation, this would roughly indicate normalization of stage 4 around 2050
