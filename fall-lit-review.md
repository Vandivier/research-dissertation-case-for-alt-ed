# A Review of the Alternative Education Literature

## 1. Introduction

This research reviews and synthesizes a number of sources as part of an ongoing research effort to assist the understanding and advising of education provision and consumption. The paper is chiefly concerned with the synthesis of the following eight key books, ordered temporally and identified by section:

1. 2008, Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns, Clayton M. Christensen, Curtis W. Johnson, and Michael B. Horn
2. 2011, The Innovative University: Changing the DNA of Higher Education from the Inside Out, Clayton M. Christensen and Henry J. Eyring
3. 2013, College (Un) Bound, Jeffrey Selingo
4. 2014, Blended, Heather Staker and Michael B. Horn
5. March 2015, College Disrupted: The Great Unbundling of Higher Education, Ryan Craig
6. April 2015, Creative Schools: The Grassroots Revolution That’s Transforming Education, Ken Robinson
7. Jan 2018, The Case Against Education, Bryan Caplan
8. Sept 2018, A New U: Faster + Cheaper Alternatives to College, Ryan Craig

Other works are referred to incidentally. This paper adds to existing knowledge in that several of these books have never been reviewed within a journal of economics, and no paper exists which specifically compares and contrasts these books.

A further bit of background information which will prove useful is on the use of certain terms. This information is equally background information and also a result of the synthesis of this literature. The reconciled meaning of these terms assists in creating a standard way to comparatively analyze traditional and alternative modes of education. Due to length, this discussion of terms is provided a dedicated section 

The first section provides the motivation for this paper and describes the organization of this paper. The second section discusses variance in the use of key terms across the literature, then settles the meaning of certain key terms for the purpose of this paper. Each section inclusively between section 3 and section 10 is responsible for reviewing one of the six key books this paper is generally concerned with. The sections are ordered temporally. That is, the same order they were listed above. Temporal ordering was done for conciseness, and also to clarify changes over time. Later work sometimes builds on earlier work, so temporal ordering removes the need for various explanatory asides. Changes over time are specifically summed up in section 10. Section 11 concludes by anticipating future work which may build on this paper.

## 2. Terms

1. traditional/alternative or non-traditional is common but ambiguous
    1. Big Tent alternativism narrowly defines the traditional model and calls alternative everything else; when in doubt, assume this invocation
    2. Small Tent alternativism narrowly defines an alternative model and goes over that; however, there are many such alternative models and even the same term is sometimes used in different ways. So I will sometimes use this invocation, but I will also define terms scoped specifically to this paper.
2. online learning / elearning isn't good enough because universities these days offer fully-online courses
3. alterative/traditional isn't even super clean bc of hybrid models; we need to distinguish between pure traditional, hybrid, and pure alternative; as such it's easy to realize most of the action is in the hybrid space.
4. why do we care about these labels? what is our overall optimization concern? We care about helping people. Notice that the optimal solution immediately varies depending on our goal, and all of these goals have some merit. As such, solutions need to be personalized and individualized. As we will see, the education literature itself repeats this exact point so frequently as to become obvious and foundational to any practitioner. While policy discussions are the furthest from my interest here, I find it interesting to passingly note the deep irony between individualized learning as a foundational requirement and actual public policies, in the US or around the world, implemented or proposed, which invariably contain massive one-size-fits-all implications. As such, any application must first define clear operationalizations for each goal and a clear weighting for each goal to create an optimized action plan:
    1. Getting employed quickly
    2. Getting employed cheaply
    3. Optimizing lifetime earnings
    4. Optimizing education for disadvantaged groups
5. Key difference hinges on public funding, which in turn hinges on formal accredation; so that becomes a nice bright line for alternative/traditional
6. Useful distinction between credential, (education, learning, schooling, pedagogy), and pathway
    1. credential is an artifact issued by a provider to a student which is then presented by the student to others as evidence of skill or knowledge
    2. education is sometimes distinguished from learning. Ken Robinson, for example, says that learning doesn't always result from education. Here, the term education is used to indicate the education system and pedagogical method. This is in direct contrast to a long-running populist distinction which aligns education and learning. Grant allen said 'i have never let my schooling get in the way of my education.' In keeping with this populist distinction, I refer to pedagogy as such or may call it schooling. I consider education equivalent to learning. That is, if the student does not know X, he was in fact not educated about X even if he sat in class during a lecture on X. https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/09/25/schooling-vs-education/
    3. Learning is universally an unambiguously understood to mean that the student has learned about X. While this paper intends to use both learning and education unambiguously, it's useful to know the literature more broadly doesn't do that.
    4. Not sure we need to explain in further detail schooling, or if it can be a discussion on the term group
    5. Not sure we need to explain in further detail pedagogy, or if it can be a discussion on the term group
    6. A pathway refers to the cross-time collection of actions taken to achieve an outcome. It's possible to execute a combination of non-traditional activities to achieve a traditional result and vice versa. Obtaining a 4 year college degree via online classes or credit by examination would be an example of achiveing a traditional credential through an alternative pathway. This concept is interesting because the variety of pathways allow for better personalization and potentially better individual return on investment.

## 5. On College (Un) Bound

In the introductory section, before chapter 1, Selingo agrees with Caplan and disagrees with one reading of Christiansen in that he sees government forces providing universities with a barrier against market forces. Selingo and Caplan argue that universities will not disappear any time soon.

Jeff agrees that the bundled service model of the traditional 4-year undergraduate degree is collapsing, but rather than foreseeing a market takeover by nimbler competitors, Jeff is optimistic that universities will be able to adapt. This theme of universities succesfully adapting to become like their competitors, rather than being ousted by competitors, is a major theme of the book.

Jeff's thesis seems to contextualize a series of related wagers put forth by Caplan as wrong-headed. Caplan argues "New Tech Won't Gut Higher Education," [4] Bryan has indicated sustained confidence by offering a series of similar wagers over time. As recently as September 2018, Bryan has wagered that the fraction of American 18-24 year-olds enrolled in traditional four-year colleges will not significantly decrease [5]. This wager, however, hardly shows that new technology hasn't been deeply disruptive. Four-year colleges have maintained enrollment in large part by adapting. Utilizing new technologies, partnering with and giving credit for learning from non-traditional providers, engaging online or hybrid courses, and supporting timeframes varying widely from the fictional four-year standard.

In chapter 1, Jeff notices that many universities are creating degrees which sound vocational, like graphic design or athletic training. He reads this as a sign of disruption. In chapter 2, Jeff notes that some degrees cost the university money. These include majors like Chemistry which are generally well reputed. This seems to be an unaccounted complication to the calculation of social benefit by major found in Caplan and others.

Chapters 2, 4, and 5 detail some ways in which power is shifting from the teachers to the students in the university. One way is simple expenditure. Non-learning service spending has increased much faster than faculty spending in recent years. Selingo indicates this is a positive change which goes hand-in-hand with disruptive pedagogies like the flipped classroom.

Chapter 5 notes that many students graduate with excess credits. Associate degree graduates graduate with 19 extra credits on average, and 16 is the average at the bachelor's level. Excess credits are attributable in part to major-switching and transferring. Such excess credit serves to inflate actual student costs over, student expectations, estimates published by universities, and even academic calculations of degree cost and return. In chapter 6, Jeff states that 40% of college freshman require remedial course work. This inflates cost in a comparable way.

In chapter 5, Jeff suggests that many college freshman decide on a major based on the recommendations of a relative. In an obvious way this is problematic, but it is also encouraging because it provides evidence that student major selection is somewhat open to external influence, and this allows us to relax the assumption that strategies utilized to improve student education must hold the major constant.

College (Un) Bound is rich in qualitative observation and plausible reasoning, but occassionally wanting in data and also occassionally stretching what counts as plausible reasoning past the breaking point. One instance is observed in chapter 6, where Jeff states that if match.com can make two people fall in love, then surely society can design a better college experience using technology.

In chapter 6, Jeff draws a parallel between online disruption to print media and online disruption to higher education. This comparison presents an opportunity to describe some types of thought on the issue of innovation in education, and provides some evidence in favor of one type. One thought is pure disruption, a la Christiansen, which would indicate that new firms would initially carve out niches and ultimately kick incumbants out of the market. An anatagonistic idea would be relatively pure conservatism. This idea would indicate that the existing institutions are still a good market fit and the alleged disruptors are no such thing. Change is not actually likely to occur.

A middle-ground between the two would be market adaptation. In this view, some niche firms enter in with some geniunely innovative technologies and existing institutions are geniunely threatened, but threatened institutions adapt to integrate new technology and as a result such firms are not ousted from the market. The market adaptation story is Jeff's view, and his parallel to the disruption of print media is apropos. In media, legacy providers still hold a major share of the market, but their activites have changed in response to integrating new technologies.

Also in chapter 6, Jeff states that a problem with MOOCs is their failure to deliver academic credit. Jeff claims this won't be a problem for long, as MOOC and other alternative learning providers will continue to partner with universities.

According to chapter 7, 23% of students from families with over $100,000 of annual income attended to community college which is up from 12% five years ago. First, this may indicate that American society is at a point where income effects dominate social stigma associated with non-traditional education. Second, the degree of that stigma is expected to weaken as this pattern continues. Another topic in chapter 8 is the comparison between a competency based degree plan and a degree plan based on the credit hour. A competency based degree plan is an innovative approach which allows students to complete a degree more cheaply and quickly.

Southern New Hampshire University and Western Governors University‎ are mentioned as leaders in competency based education. Paul LeBlanc identifies himself as a disrupter. He considers the online learning revolution old news and competency based education is the more recent innovation. LeBlanc believes that competency based education will come from existing institutions, and will exist alongside four-year programs.

In chapter 9, Jeff states that an important measure of active learning is called time on task. Time on task is just what it seems to be, which is the amount of time spent on some task. It is a form of active learning or learning-by-doing. Active learning has been shown more effective than traditional learning methods including lecture. These considerations imply there is a false distinction between education and work. The correct distinction is between education and schooling. Schooling can also be seen as a form of labor with non-positive wages.

In chapter 10, Selingo discusses a company called OnShore which has partnered with universities to obtain college credit for training some employees receive while working with OnShore. Jeff states this program is similar to an apprenticeship. In the second half of chapter 10, Jeff criticizes some modes of economic analysis of the value of an education. I think he does so unsuccessfully. Many of his comments in this section are questionable in importance or dealt with by Caplan.

In section 14, after the conclusion, Selingo discusses several universities with interesting features in their education programs. For example, Wake Tech Community College in North Carolina admits a certain number of 8th graders from the surrounding area into a program which takes four to five years to complete. This program results in both a high school diploma and two years of college credit, which may include a community college degree or certificate in a health science field. Selingo states this is part of a broader movement called the early college movement.

WTCC is one example of many which show that optimal alternative education planning begins well before high school graduation, and in many scenarios even before high school admission. Many high schools have interesting programs which yield college credit, college admission benefits, college cost reductions, or vocational training during high school.

Another interesting program discussed in section 14 involves Westminster College. This program requires the creation of a digital portfolio for all students. One approach to job placement recommended by proponents of alternative education is to build a digital portfolio to demonstrate skill. This technique may also be utilized by individuals who are self-taught or completely skip formal education. This adds evidence to the claim that cutting-edge universities are integrating alternative techniques. It also highlights an interesting question about whether portfolios function as credentials, learning tools, production outputs, or perhaps all of the above. Students may be able to save time and money by asking a university to evaluate a portfolio created while in high school or earlier for college credit.

A recent report indicates that ePortfolios are becoming increasingly supported by institutions of higher education, but their full value remains yet unobserved by employers because there is currently an integration bottleneck with the application tracking systems used by employers [13].

## 8. On Creative Schools

While acknowledging that education is an essentially contentested concept, Ken concisely defines learning in the introduction as the process of acquiring knowledge and skills. Ken defines education, particularly formal education, as an organized program of learning. Clearly, organization involves planning, and this precludes learning by surprise from education. I think this is a good thing, because learning by surprise seems like the sort of thing which cannot be invested in or optimized.

Around the middle of chapter 4, Ken indicates that he sees IQ as a narrow measure of intelligence intelligence. He indicates that he is a fan of the theory of multiple intelligence. Later in chapter 4 he speaks highly of self-directed learning and play for children in elementary school and ostensibly otherwise. He name dropped Peter Gray affably.

Clearly Ken and Caplan differ in their position on IQ. Their definitions on education also differ. By including self-directed learning within the concept of education, Ken adopts a broad concept of education. When Caplan argues against education, on the other hand, he clearly does not oppose vocational training in many cases, and he doesn't even oppose education for all student profiles. Caplan seems to be arguing against the four year degree, with some caveats, and also against certain public policies, not analyzing education broadly. Ken's concept of education includes alternative modes of education, and by grouping these two together it may become more plausible to argue that they can substitute for one another substantially, though imperfectly.

Around the middle of chapter 5, Ken discusses mastery learning. Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy, has called mastery learning the common sense approach to education, and a way to enhance the K-12 status quo in the US[9]. Khan refers to a long literature, dating at least back to Benjamin Bloom in 1984[10] demonstrating significantly better student outcomes under mastery learning. This brings up an interesting question about whether topics learned to mastery obtain slower fadeout. Khan indicates mastery learning as a form of personalized learning, because the pace of learning is individualized.

In chapter 5, Ken argues that the flipped classroom technique, non-substantively different from peer instruction, causes superior outcomes compared to lecture. Ken refers to Mezur[15] for empirical backing. For Ken and Mezur, pedagogies are often causally responsible, not merely asssociated, with outcomes. In chapter 6, Ken opposes engagement to boredom. In this view passion becomes synonymous with or operationalized by engagement. Ken associates personalized learning with higher passion, engagement, and grit. 

In chapter 6, Ken voices support for vocational education directly, and also for alternative pedagogical approaches which are job-like. Project based learning involves learning by creating a deliverable with a team. This is very similar to many positions of employment. Big picture learning is a pedagogical approach which emphasizes the importance of an internship. Ken also discusses design thinking in this chapter. The details of design thinking are largely extraneous, but it is a good example of a systematic analytical approach, and one which is often used in business. I wonder whether learning by reasoning is more robust against fadeout compared to fadeout of memorized knowledge which is not embedded within a larger system of reasoning. If learning by reasoning is more robust, then learning in the context of a systematic analytical approach like design thinking or economic analysis might resist fadeout.

In chapter 7, Ken reminds us that GPA is a better predictor of college completion than SAT scores, and he discusses the learning record, which is an alternative assessment scheme similar to a portfolio plus principled portfolio grading. Ken speaks highly of homeschooling towards the end of chapter 9. The afterword, occuring after chapter 10, name drops interesting thinkers in education including, Montessori and Steiner, who've lead to schools fashioned after their ideas. He says these traditions tend to emphasize personalized learning.

## 10. On A New U

Craig's book takes a non-academic style with frequent anecdote and about one joke per chapter. I find this style distracting and verbose, but perhaps the fact that this book is written in a style uncommon among top books on the subject will serve to reach a different or broader audience. There isn't much useful factual information until around the third chapter, but just when an academic may be inclined to put the book away, Criag unleashes a torrent of useful factual information, and he continues this pattern of discontinuous segments of high-density information throughout the book.

In chapter 3, Craig notes that 85% of jobs posted online, and 80% of employers, use an application tracking system (ATS). These software systems include functionality which ranks and filters candidates, primarily using keyword matching. Craig refers to Burning Glass research and to others to argue that These matching algorithms are known to have systematic accuracy problems. One key point is that ranking candidates is much easier to do using niche or technical skills and terms, rather than broad skills like communication or critical thinking. As a result, technical keywords have exploaded within job descriptions used by employers. Their use has highlighted, and perhaps exacerbated, a keyword-level skills gap. The skills gap is particularly severe at the entry level, indicating that traditional education providers are not equipping students with the specific skills employers are searching for.

Craig points out that technical terms often consist of software names or standard business process names. A competency in these categories is a good example of a middle-skill. Between high-skill labor and low-skill labor is the category of middle-skill labor, which is identified as a job that requires more than a high school diploma and less than a four-year degree [19]. The National Skills Coalition states that middle-skills "make up the largest part of the labor market in the United States and in each of the 50 states." [20]

Examples of software usage skill includes proficiency with Microsoft Office products or Salesforce. Examples of standard business processes include Agile and Design Thinking. Software usage and business processes knowledge are amenable to online learning and measurement, although they are harder to demonstrate by portfolio in comparison to programming skill. Because middle-skills are heterogenous by industry, while relatively fewer programming languages are usable across industry, it is intuitive that any particular one of the most used programming languages would face higher demand than any particular one of the most common software usage skills. These reasons give some intuition to the reality that programming jobs are particularly open to alternative education.

Later in chapter 3, Craig discusses the relatively slower pace of adaptation observed in four year colleges relative to new education providers. It's worth noting that even pro-traditional scholars like Ken Robinson admit the slower pace of adaption exhibited by four year universities. The usage of the pro-traditional label for the purposes of this paper is clarified in the section on atemporal findings. Craig states that one mechanism for this slow adaptation is the incentive structure faced by university professors. University professors are significantly motivated by their own research interests, rather than labor market requirements. Craig notes the uptrend in double majoring and attributes this behavior to a hedge on the part of students to hedge against unemployment due to misaligned curriculum.

Craig seems to echo Caplan in his discussion on credential inflation and experience inflation. Craig points to Burning Glass research data which shows interesting cases where an entry level position might require 1-3 years of experience, or a position which previously required an undergraduate degree or no degree at all might today require a Master's degree. Like Caplan, Craig concludes these increased candidate requirements are not attributable to an increase in difficulty of the underlying job. On the contrary, many jobs are considered less technical, loborious, or stressful today than prior.

Craig's analysis includes an interesting exposition of Bidwell's Matrix, referring to a working paper by Matthew Bidwell at the University of Pennsylvania. Bidwell's quadrant is a two-by-two matrix where the columns are the level of education required for a job and the rows are the levels of experience required. After reviewing a data set of about three million job descriptions, one of Bidwell's key findings is that employers are not posting jobs in the bottom-left quadrant of this matrix. The empty quadrant, as it's labeled, involves high education and low experience jobs. This is exactly where many highly educated students enter the job market.

Bidwell himself notes that his results "suggest that the accumulation of experience accentuates rather than ameliorates differences in education, contributing to the barriers facing less educated workers."[24] It appears that temporally balanced consumption of education and experience obtains when a worker chooses a significant portion of each in every period, rather than frontloading preference for either. This analytical result runs counter to existing public policy, because student loands today may only be deferred by half-time or higher course load, which effectively incentivizes the frontloading of education. It might be the case that allowing student loan payment deferral on the basis of part-time enrollment is a politically feasible change with potentially large impact on the ability of workers to smoothly obtain education and experience in a more balanced bundle.

Ernst & Young is a multinational staffing firm headquartered in London, England. They conduct a battery of assessments in order to evaluate candidates for placement fit across potentially matching roles. Employers which employ candidates referred by Ernst & Young are willing to accept candidates which possess less formal education, provided the candidates perform sufficiently well on assessment. Craig notes this move has resulted in an increase to diversity of employees at firms which partner with Ernst & Young. Craig likens the situation to a change implemented internally within Nestle. When Nestle replaced degree requirements with an assessment battery approach, the firm discovered that more than 20% of new hires would have been immediately screened out under their prior hiring model.

Craig points to a 2013 survey in which 71% of employers said they would consider hiring a candidate without a degree over another candidate with a degree. Craig mentions a seperate survey of 400 employers by Hart Research, 80% of employers indicated that it would be very or fairly useful to see an electronic portfolio of work, consistent with what is read in Salerno's College (Un)Bound and elsewhere.

Craig defines the concept of the last mile in chapter 4. The idea originated in telecom during the 1990s. The idea then was that the last mile of telecom is the portion which actually connects to a consumer's physical building. The last mile is the most difficult and expensive to build, but it is equally the most valuable. Indeed, the whole system fails if the last mile is improperly handled. In the context of an education-to-employment pipeline, last mile learning providers attempt to take college graduates and turn them into an employed person. University career services are intended to do the same thing, but they are substantially less effective.

One common last mile learning implementation is the bootcamp. Craig states that "most student-pay bootcamps show placement rates north of 80%." Those placements are measured to have occured within 6 months. While bootcamps, and last mile providers in general, are most common for software development roles and development-adjacent roles like designer, business analyst, software tester, scrum master, and so on, they do exist for entirely non-development roles. Sales is one non-development role which has a substantial number of reputed last mile providers.

When considering the return from any of these providers, it is critical to adjust for risk. Some providers often employment guarantees, financing, high salary upon graduation, and high graduation rates, while other providers offer fewer or none of those features. Tuition and time costs are also critical factors to consider. Learning course costs range from less than $100 into the 5-digit range. Some learning providers charge nearly as much as a traditional university would. That becomes intuitive when it is observed that some alternative learning providers partner with traditional universities to offer products which are ultimately indistinguishable from the traditional product in the eyes of an employer. Coursera, for example, offers a Master in Computer Science through a partnership with the University of Illinois[25]. The time to complete an alternative program of learning can range from days to years. Craig notes that the subset of alternative learning programs called bootcamps range in completion time from four weeks to two years, with 14 weeks as an average.

Few economists or education scholars believe that alternative learning providers directly substitute for traditional providers in a winner-take-all fashion, but Craig points to a survey by the National Association of College and University Business Officers wherein 57% of colleges and universities attribute "the likes of software coding bootcamps" for enrollment declines, at least for particular subjects. Craig states that there are "now" 95 non-accreddited so-called coding schools, although they only began popping up in 2012. He attributes this figure to Course Report, but my own search on the Course Report website indicates that as of December 2018 there are 332 bootcamps supporting a full-stack development position[26], a particularly intense kind of high-skill software developer. A full-stack developer is expected to have all skills held by a front end developer and all skills expected by a back end developer.

One explanation for the variance between Craig's count of 95 schools and my count of 332 is that the "now" Craig refers to was during 2017, while researching for the book, rather than during the publishing year. Craig notes that in 2017 these US-based bootcamps educated about 1/3 as many software developers as all US-based universities combined. A second, harder to believe, explanation is that the number of code schools on Course Report increased from 95 to 332 during 2018. The final plausible variance explanation I can come up with is that Craig somehow filtered the list further without making it clear in the book. To illustrate, as of December 2018, Course Report documents 552 bootcamps[27]. This includes bootcamps for sales, design, and other non-developer bootcamps. When filtered to include bootcamps which at least offer full-stack development, a count of 332 is observed. When filtering down to include bootcamps which only offer development and nothing else, it may be the case that a count around 95 is observed. This filtering cannot be done using Course Report's searching feature, however, so Craig must have filtered that data by hand.

In any case, employers are extremely happy with the graduates of these bootcamps. 99.8% of bootcamp graduate employers surveyed indicate that they plan to hire more. 72% say bootcamp graduates are equally qualified compared to university graduates, and 12% say bootcamp graduates are better prepared than university graduates.

## General Findings

General findings are worth breaking into two groups. The first group is atemporal findings. The second group includes trends over time.

### Atemporal Findings

Intellectually, there is a clean distinction between a disruption camp and a non-disruption camp. In the real world, the leaders in either camp exist much more in the middle of the two than toward the extemes. The leading thinkers and practitioners in favor of the university system acknowledge that universities should continue to innovate, and adopting non-traditional features is practically, and in some sense tautologically, the means to that end. The leading thinkers and practitioners opposed to the legacy system acknowledge that the legacy system is firmly entrenched and will continue to be so for many years, and so the optimal course of action for individuals and for society is for new providers to integrate, cooperate, and coordinate with those legacy systems, instead of attempting to steal consumers in a winner-take-all fashion.

The result is that leading thinkers and practitioners on both sides largely support both alternative education and traditional education. Moreover, leaders on both sides generally agree on which pedagogies, technologies, and so on, provide optimal results in most cases. A cursory glance at the non-book literature demonstrates the difficulty involved in locating a formal paper with citations in excess of the single digits which promotes the traditional lecture mode of class instruction. I could only find one from by Kalogeras in 1976 [15]. While the magazines occassionally headline an article which pretends to defend lecture, seldom make and evidence-based case and often essentially concede the point. Consider *In Defense of the Lecture*, a 2014 article from the Chronicle of Higher Education. This article points out specific virtues of lecture, even while conceding "...lecturing as a means of transferring basic factual information is a poor way to teach. I agree..."

The differences in opinion seem rather limitted, and they almost universally apply to macroeconomic issues. The closest thing to disagreement on microeconmic choices seems to be twofold:

1 - Some scholars are aware of interesting programs or technologies which other scholars are not aware of.

2 - Scholars heterogenously trust the payoff claims of particular programs of alternative learning.

3 - Some scholars oppose particular alternative education techniques.

Expanding on the third point above, Eric Hanushek recently stated "We should not delude ourselves into thinking that Trump’s apprenticeship expansion will substitute for our failing K-12 schooling system...Vocationally-trained workers with relatively narrow skills face a harsher labor market with time as the nature of production changes."[22] Along the same lines, a Brooking study to which Hanushek contributed found that excess utilization of an apprenticeship model at the social level could generate a skill gap [23]. Despite Hanushek's particular position on the Trump plan, and perhaps his general opposition to excess utilization of apprenticehip, it is clear that he does not oppose alternative education writ large, and that he does not deny the utility of vocational training for particular individuals.

It is worth mentioning that both of these main microeconomic concerns are being addressed over time by projects like Credential Engine, which seeks to comprehensively catalog non-accredited credentials and standardize their outcome measurement and reporting[16]. An alternative strategy is provided by firms like Degreed, which markets a generalized service to measure any skill [17]. This approach simplifies the measurement trust problem from a need to trust heterogenous providers to the need to trust a single provider of learning measurement, Degreed.

Many less comprehensive skill measurement providers exist. Pluralsight, for example, is a relatively well known and reputed firm in the IT market. Pluralsight provides a standard measurement service for a specific range of skills[18]. This measurement process obtains independent from where the learning or skill development occured. In this sense, employers can choose to trust a skill measurement provider instead of directly trusting a learning provider. This simplifies the analysis problem for employers, and it also creates an additional incentive for learning providers to provide good content. If many students pass through an alternative learning process, then perform poorly during standard evaluation, the poor performance becomes attributable in part or whole to that alternative learning process.

The main sources of debate seem to be on macroeconomic concerns. These concerns are completely out of my interest, but they are worth noting:

1 - What is the best course of action for the mean or median student?

2 - What should be done with public funds for education?

3 - Should the existing educational requirements for certain professional licenses be reevaluated, or should certain licenses be created or destroyed?

It seems to me that if there is to be any meaning to the labelling of a scholar as in favor of traditional education, it merely means that, with respect to the macroeconomic points mentioned above, the scholar believes at least one of, and possibly all of, the following:

1 - The mean or median student should obtain a four year degree.

2 - The growth in public education spending should remain constant, or perhaps grow.

3 - At least some professions benefit from licensing, and at least some licenses benefit from requiring accredited education.

Caplan would represent, then, a non-traditional position. Hanushek would represent a moderate position between these extremes, arguing that policymakers should not grow spending, or perhaps cut it non-drastically, but mainly focus on spending in a more intelligent way[21].

Under this macroeconomic categorization, even the proponent of traditional education need not say a particular student should necessarily obtain a four year degree, although it would seem to be a null hypothesis. It is this null hypothesizing mechanism which finally allows us to obtain some meaningful distinction at the microeconomic level, whereas breaking scholars into camps according to their attitude on disruption seems like a red herring.

### Trends Over Time

- Udacity is our bright-line. Nothing was the same before and after 2011/2012
  - Founded in 2011
  - First online courses launched in 2012
  - First courses for college credit in 2013
  - First formal partnership with university for full-fledged degree in 2014
  - First independent alternative credential, Nanodegree, in 2014
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Udacity&oldid=853136895
  - Udacity may be seen as a microcosm of the entire education movement.
  - Another provider which sheds light is Khan Academy. Their approach is even further embedded within traditional education.
  - Khan recently applied to create a world-recognized secondary credential but didn't get funded; had it gotten funded what would we call it? a traditional or alternative credential? It would have been an innovative approach to obtaining a traditionally accreditted education. It would have been a hybrid. Udacity is essentially market-leading and tightly, although perhaps decreasingly, coupled to IT. Khan Academy is much more mainstream in education and associated with most fields of study and industries of practice. As such, Khan Academy may better represent the state of the average education. This would put the state of the average education in Udacity cerca 2012; you generally cannot obtain college credit through Khan Academy today, although Khan has officially partnered with College Board for SAT and AP prep (as of 2018 or when?), but Khan cannot sponsor a student to take an AP exam or directly obtain credit.

    - Khan founded in 20017; so, roughly, 1 udacity-year is 10 actual years; using a non-serious linear extrapolation, this would roughly indicate normalization of stage 4 around 2050

- Portfolios, and perhaps digital portfolios in particular, are in demand by employers and becoming trendy among universities. While they have been trendy with alternative providers for some time, they are only recently becoming more standardized.
- Apprenticeship programs are making a comeback. They never truly left Germany, but they have revived from slumber in the UK. Under Trump, the US saw a major step forward for a particular implementation of apprenticeship, but it was a controversial implementation.
- Like apprenticeship, many scholars favor evidence-based learning, even while criticizing the assessment-based implementation thereof. In general, portfolios are a substantially less controversial approach to evidence-based learning and hiring.
