NOTE: Other than this note, the content of this file is copied and pasted into fall-cover-letter.docx. It is further formatted within the docx. This pattern is a temporary workaround because I haven't yet implented the md-to-pdf processing. It is not recommended that this process is followed next semester or in the future, for text-diff and version control reasons. Once future artifacts are satisfactorily created, these files should be removed from the repository.

# Fall Cover Letter

This cover letter introduces fall-literature-review.docx. The two documents are seperated because the other document is intended to be written in the fashion of a proper paper, and this document outlines other work conducted in the Fall 2018 semester which was out-of-scope for the fall-literature-review.docx. This document also outlines planned work for Spring 2019.

## Reading the Literature

This semester I focused on identifying and reading the literature. I identified 8 books and read 4 of them. My findings from reading those books is written up in a more formal way within fall-literature-review.docx. That document is intended to grow in the Spring and eventually become a literature review section in my dissertation. In chronological order, the identified books are:

1. 2008, Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns, Clayton M. Christensen, Curtis W. Johnson, and Michael B. Horn
2. 2011, The Innovative University: Changing the DNA of Higher Education from the Inside Out, Clayton M. Christensen and Henry J. Eyring
3. *2013, College (Un) Bound, Jeffrey Salingo
4. 2014, Blended, Heather Staker and Michael B. Horn
5. March 2015, College Disrupted: The Great Unbundling of Higher Education, Ryan Craig
6. *April 2015, Creative Schools: The Grassroots Revolution Thatâ€™s Transforming Education, Ken Robinson
7. *Jan 2018, The Case Against Education, Bryan Caplan
8. *Sept 2018, A New U: Faster + Cheaper Alternatives to College, Ryan Craig

* These books were read this semester.

## Attitudinal Survey Update

In addition to reading the literature, I collected additional samples for an attitudinal survey on alternative credentials. Because this resulted in a panel where t = 2, most findings are still insignificant. More samples will be collected over time. Basic analysis in STATA is stored at the below URL:

One weak but interesting finding which will need to be replicated with more data is that political conservatives seem more attitudinally opposed to alternative credentials than political liberals. This is interesting because liberals are typically seen as favoring the status quo in education, but it may be explained in part by greater openness to innovation.

## Spring 2019 Plans

I plan to finish reading the books described above and then systematically approach the journals. I have some blog articles outlining my systematic approach, which basically involves targeting high-citation articles, high-citation individuals, and high-prestige journals:
http://www.afterecon.com/economics-and-finance/identifying-key-papers-in-the-economics-of-education/

Instead of reading the articles alone, I plan to hold a biweekly reading group.

The main output for the semester will be a working literature review paper which I may want to discuss submitting to a journal.

I also plan to collect more samples for the attitudinal survey. If anything interesting pops up, I may write that up, but the panel is temporally thin still so I don't have high expectations in the Spring.
