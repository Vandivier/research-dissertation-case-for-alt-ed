# Abstract

Recent literature deflates the value of education, but my analysis defines education along a traditional-alternative continuoum and shows that the value of alternative education remains a strong investment choice.

*learning is something we do by necessity; the question is how best to do it not whether or not to do it; specifically, autonomous vs directed learning. there is a careful distinction between voluntarily directed and involuntarily directed learning.

Key question is about the extent to which alternative credentials do or do not subsitute for traditional credentials, and what factors modify that substitution amount.

Secondary question would be on whether some general metric of abnormality is related to learning effectiveness (even non-linearly).
