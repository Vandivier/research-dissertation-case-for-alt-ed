# Abstract

Recent literature deflates the value of education, but my analysis defines education along a traditional-alternative continuoum and shows that the value of alternative education remains a strong investment choice.

# Overview




---

one job market paper
one tie-to-existing
not necessarily the best idea - but - write one great paper then do proposal
  - lot of details about one good

2 years - eminently realistic
going on job market a year from january

publications - 

as long as you've got a letter saying 'we're pleased to accept' it's good enough
  - encourage to revise and resubmit = 20%
  - I submitted = 1%

  get a good draft...he will read draft and submit... read more!!!! in prestigious journals by famous people

pick one, make it highly cited and relevant to other prestigious work (currenter is better)

10 - 20 pages

bryan is more optimistic on alternative education for real learning but maybe not for job outcomes (this is where I can maybe be interesting, LATER PAPER TOO ORIGINAL)

Portfolio theory and simultaneous operation of a portfolio as 1) a credential/signal, and, 2) an output of productivity and geniune learning/skill evidence (LATER PAPER TOO ORIGINAL)

Some directly relevant papers saying 'dearth of data, need new data' (you can cite them, but it's not enough and bordering on too original)

site boring papers and try to be a boring paper (add the interesting stuff on low key or later)

building on/referencing Caplan's work is a risky move (do it low key or in a later paper)

Recommended approach: FIND PAPERS ON RETURNS TO ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION and say "hey I'm just doing another one of these things nbd...low key on low key my man u kno..."

Paper 2 is the emphasis: comparing traditional employment outcomes to alternative employment outcomes and then *my* measures of alternative employment outcomes

classifiers can be included or ignored - not recommended as seperate economic paper (go ahead an include for now; knock it out of the park)

attitudinal survey is currently fit for a think tank, not an academic job; will that change with panel? idk. (maybe a lower quality paper later on)
