- Ryan Craig got Jeb Bush to endorse his book, and he published it prominently on the front cover above the title. What kind of targeting is that? Craig seems to be advocating disruption and alternative education, but neocons in general and Jeb in particular are notorious public ed spenders. Jeb is clearly a neocon, not a classical or paleoconservative, and I state that as a factual observation not an attempt at slander, but suppose Jeb were a paleoconservative. The idea here might be that pro-market conservatives would support disruption, but my survey indicates that progressives are more open to alternative education, and my literature review indicates that real disruption comes about through integration, not substitution.

- Are sheepskin effects changing over time? did the recession impact them? if caplan is right (and I think he is), but if I am also right and universities are evolving to adopt from alternatives, one would suspect that the alternatives would be less socially unacceptable; so rudimentary analysis would show smaller sheepskin effects, and complex analysis would show that specifically among the population that receives alternative education, sheepskin effects are small and/or shrinking compared to 10 or 20 years ago.

- Survey of Firms:
1 - How frequently does your firm perform employee evaluations? (none, anually, biannually, between biannually and monthly, monthly, continuously, other)
2 - (Optional) Leave a URL to your company website. (Researcher can use this info to look up firm revenue, size, etc).
3 - During your employee evaluations, do employees receive numeric scores for performance?
4 - Other than the numeric scores your employees receive during employee evaluation, does your firm collect other measurements of employee performance?
5 - How does your firm measure employee performance?
    * Our firm depends on licensure or evaluation, and that licensure or evaluation involves numerical scoring, not simply participation.
    * Our firm internally and numerically measures general performance.
    * Our firm internally and numerically measures performance with specific tasks or skills.
    * Our firm does not numerically measure performance.

Are you equipped to measure employee skill?
Do you trust ANY skill measurement service, or do you trust only internal skill

for applied learning plan / personal economic management plan, distinguish my approach from careerbuilder.com
* scale of 1 to 10: willingness to change: Does user want jobs that are already a good fit, or are they willing to take a job that may be more stressful to work in or take longer to get in exchange for more pay, employment rate, etc.
* measure grit (structurally interacts with willingness to change)
* change timeline? (you can't become a different person tomorrow w new skills and personality even if you were willing to do so.)
* high school gpa? (estimate college completion; does class rank matter in addition?)
* iq?
* multi-factor personality? (big 5, kaldor-hicks at least...peterson's version?)
* current education level, gender, age, sex, household income (calculate all the things)
* it should produce a career result with explainers, estimated stress level, estimated reward level, and a pathway to get there
  * have option to 'rule out' paths, eg "I don't want to go to university" or "at least not that specific university"
* user should be able select # of results, sort by stress score / match level, or by benefit score, or by net. they should get a warning when match / benefit / net is not statistically confident.

alternative credentials net promoter score: aggregate top online learning products and average them;
* every product NPS is a combination of systematic favor and non-systematic favor; non-systematic favor is towards the underlying concept or technology, eg online learning, systematic is in favor of the specific product
* averaging nullifies the systematic to some extent, like indexing stocks
* now: compare average NPS of different technologies over time. Esp other investment types and other skill-enhancing things. do universities publish NPS? also, does Degreed dude ever regress NPS on SkillIQ?

I think it’s worth noting that when many students enter college their brains are not fully developed. Also I think many of them don’t understand the value of a dollar because they haven’t worked much. This allows them to except dad without really understanding at a volitional level or at at a deeper level how much debt they’re really getting into. Working a bit before going to school would help in either of these cases

Sal Kan is described as a disruptor but he’s also partnering with universities, so it’s not as if he’s necessarily advocating alternative, I think is very much open to like working together

Check out Degree Compress course recommendations software. For part of my dissertation and or for part of a book which I may write as a result of this research, hey section should be devoted to optimizing advice for the student who does decide that the traditional route is best. Degree compass and things like intelligent university selection and things like intelligent professor in course selection and things like utilizing cheap or free online software to assist in studying to facilitate pass rate and other things like that may all be helpful

Chapter 8 in College unbound discusses a program called StraighterLine. Look into this as an alternative path education.

*  in favor of demonstrated learning and competency-based learning; another buzzword 'non-institutional learning toward credentials'
* competency-based approach https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S12oNjc9Uk
* competency = capability = skill

Maybe I should focus less on alternative education and more on affective education? My book can be called the case for education with Claire reference to Kaplan. The idea here is to test everything and hold onto the good, where traditional education must have some good because it’s a robust institution. The question becomes what’s good about it.

Create a list of 5 to 10 notable data sources about higher education and also alternative education of possible although I don’t think those exist although maybe some niche things like charter schools and private schools homeschooling on schooling and so forth maybe those neck things have associated surveys. One for Hyridge Acacian is the national survey of like college student engagement. Another I think it’s called like the ACL American commute or ACS American community survey something like that. One of the later chapters in college I’m down like 56 or seven discusses standardized measurements of Hyridge Acacian outcomes I think it Chapter 7 or eight actually maybe chapter 9 or 10

In the 13th section of college unbound, right after the conclusion, Jeff goes over a short list of recommended/innovative universities. This information should be included in my section on advising students for whom a traditional school is a good fit

----------------------------------------------------------------
Beginning notes for Creative schools Mike and Robinson. In chapter 1 he defines education which is like obvious and useful although the previous two books they didn’t do that also his definition of education is more broad in scope and ends up actually contradicting the definition used by Kaplan.

In chapter 2 highlights a connection between personalized learning and passion. As Kevin Carey night notes and also Angela Duckworth, grit is composed of passion and perseverance. There also seems to be an element of reciprocity in the smoky road story.

Creative schools chapter 2 discusses PISA, a standardized test in data source. TODO: gather a list of such sources.

In chapter 3 Chan (Ken?) has a section specifically on so called alternative education. He knows that these are programs designed for students who are having trouble in school or have altogether dropped out. This is worn out and some of the academic literature on the topic of alternative education. This is a an example of what I’m not talking about when I talk about alternative education. So perhaps I need a different term notably the alternative education can refers to often coincides with low performing students. It sometimes coincides with Entech or innovative approaches to education, but the goal is to enable low performance students. In contrast when I discuss alternative education, I’m very interested in how to unlock the potential of high-performing students. I’m not simply interested in facilitating learning for low performing students, although that is interesting, but I am interested equally in allowing high-performing students to reach they were highs that they would never have seen under the traditional model.

Perhaps, Non-traditional education is a better word for my use case compared to alternative education.

I could perhaps even utilize an Autre term a more odd term to really distinguish my definition and perhaps bring some positive connotation. For example progressive education or something else like that. Or innovative education or new education. Something that has a semantic appeal to facilitate marketing, Tiffany still take normalization, and to undercut conscious or unconscious bias which would inhibit adoption or a pose my views. It very well may deserve a section of a paper on a note about semantics.

unrelated to book for a moment; in my own research I showed that people who are more familiar with alt creds tend to favor them and have a higher chance of saying they work for entry level position and are good for society overall. In my limited temporal sample I've yet to see awareness is growing, but the books seem to indicate awareness is growing. New thought: use Google Trends!

Side note - does caplan acknowledge endogeneity between public policy ie funding and conformity value? Eg it’s conformity signaling bc everyone does it and everyone does it bc it’s cheap, so when u take public subsidy away it will in fact reduce the conformity signal value

Prepare 5 questions for caplan as a separate artifact

Towards the middle of Chapter 6 10 references Braxton to talk about a concept called building learning power BLP. This seems to be a learning how to learn paradigm were there some sort of accumulation of something called learning power was just sort of like a stock or a capital of some sort.

Ch6 39 min mark he discusses creativity, imagination, and innovation in a sensible way. He basically calls it applies innovation and goes through some myths such as it’s only ties to art or only certain people have it and it can’t be taught or developed

During the last 20 minutes of chapter 6, 10 talks about the centrality of inspiring students. This seems to be the reverse of the student having grit. GRIT. This seems to be like in Dowing grit or training grit. This relates to something Kaplan talked about when he said inspirational teaching can be valuable intrinsically as American good. 410, some of this is charisma on the part of the teacher and some of this inspiration comes from relatable material. Passion or inspiration is the opposite of boredom and this beer, and nothing makes a topic more boring than being abstract to the point of not being practically usable or even understandable. One thing students became passionate about was music, in particular when they could use an iPad with a free GarageBand app so that they didn’t need to be technically skilled musicians but they can still create whatever music they wanted. Humor also plays a role. Another approach was to joke about farting and turn that into a lesson on chemistry and gases. While the notion of decomposing great into perseverance and ambition is interesting, things like shimmer and other things we can uncover in this investigation lead us to realize that passion may complement what is distinct from ambition.

As I Listen to the introduction of chapter 7, I realize that the audiobook considered the prelude a distinct chapter, so everything is one chapter off. What audible considers chapter 7, the text itself refers to as chapter 6. So prior to this note when I said chapter 6 I meant chapter 5

Early chapter 7 which is to say early chapter 6 does a good job of going over and I’ll turn it of pedagogy called project-based learning. This could be advertise a bowl to an employer because project-based learning as much in common with projectbased production that is many employers, particularly an IT and corporate setting, have projectbased production with project managers and so on. Of course this is not all employers, so part of a good education involves working backwards from a concrete set of employers not even just jobs but actually The employer.

I’m just going to go ahead and continue using the Audible chapters and I’ll correct for them at analysis time. In chapter 7 about 12 to 13 minutes and, Ken states that a recent move in education is to focus on what students should have in terms of capabilities as a result of their education. He says this is a good idea. This is exactly parallel what I think is a good idea when I say that we should work backwards not only from a profession but even from a specific employer. Similarly, specific classes should work backwards from Desired capabilities. When we say should we are proposing that this approach will lead to a higher quality for a lower price, but this does need to be proven and it does assumed that hire Kody for a lower price is better. But that’s not really controversial. Ken goes further than to state that capabilities as the proper ends and he actually states eight competencies which she thinks all students must end up with. I think this is substantially more controversial. He does not demonstrate hire chief meant being associated with these except through possible reasoning, and he leaves out quite a few important competencies in the job market, he also disregards that mini capabilities should be self selected by the students in other words Capability production should be individualized

On further reflection cans eight capabilities are even further controversial because some of them directly a pose what Caplan’s Argues that employers are looking for, such as being normalAnd conforming, which seems to be somewhat opposed to being creative and innovative. By the way I’m not arguing with Ken, I think the capabilities he names are very often cool, but he doesn’t very well prove the necessity of these and neither are they obviously what employers want, even if they are good for the purposes of human capital and real learning

Add about the 16 minute mark, can it gives a list of what is meant by critical thinking and that it is in excess of formal reasoning. This is interesting and relates to my conversation on Weather critical thinking is affectively detailed thinking. I think detailed thinking is different from what Ken has in mind, but Kenst seems to use many terms in his own way rather than in a way tradition of the literature

Ken also mixes public and private interest in his description of the egg capabilities all students should have for example one of them is being a good citizen which is inextricably intertwined to a functioning democracy according to Ken. However one this seems to be a social benefit not a private benefit and to this restricts his concepts of education only to the Society switch wish to maintain a democratic system.

At the 33 minute mark ken discusses design thinking. This is a common paradigm in agile software development and also in professional design more broadly. Ken does a good job of emphasizing the importance of teaching entire modes of thinking and application over or equal to specific classes, facts, and skills. I wonder if learning by reasoning is more robust against fadeout and framework based learning is like a macrocosm of reasoning to a solution. Eg economic analysis or design thinking or agile planning, where knowledge of a new concept can fit inside of an existing framework, and sometimes the framework can even help or lead to the discovery of the new information. Anecdotally I’ve often found reasoning to an answer far easier than memorization

Chapter 7/8 is about testing. One teacher estimates standardized test prep requires about one month of work per year. The issues raised are the common issues and no innovative solutions are discussed. As economists often remark, obvious to our paradigm, it is not obvious that these tests are a net bad or a poor return on investment despite having some real costs. Ken states that there are two main problems, neither of which I consider claimed in a convincing way: 1, instead of becoming a means to better education, standardization has become an ends in itself, and 2) tests focus on limited forms of response, such as multiple choice, they don’t focus on what’s important, they eschew complexity or nuance, and they don’t account for situational factors on the part of the test taker

One of the few more serious issues raised in chapter 7/8 is that many schools and school districts are incentivized to locate hire attention to students near the cut off point for pass because their funding is tied to pass rates. As a result they may under educate both low performing and high-performing students and they also are anecdotally rumored to encourage strategic diagnosis of ADHD in some cases.

They were vary compliant, could easily follow direction, and their creativity were just about drained is a comment around 12 min mark in ch 8 regarding students as they prep for SAT. But then what if this is exactly what employers want? Again ken Robinson vs caplan on good education. Ken might well argue that employers should want creative employers, but the distinction between an ideal education system and an ideal education system contingent on the actual labor market is not well made in kens work

In chapter 8 Ken reminds us again of both his insights and blindspots. He correctly reminds us that GPA is a better predictor of college completion than sat scores, but he also goes further citing someone who says that sat scores measure nothing of value, seemingly ignoring the fact that sat scores measure iq fairly well and correlate with life success. Ken emphasizes that he isn’t rejecting the need for assessment but he is complaining about the form assessment now takes. He seems to be particularly critical of standardized and high stakes testing. Clearly such tests have a role as low stakes testing is ineffective (eg performance is better predicted on incentivized tests while non incentivized tests are noisy, high stakes are effectively high incentive) and something like personalized, as opposed to standardized, testing would be useful for self-to-self comparison but not cross-individual comparison. Among education scholars it is popular to talk negatively about standardization, but economists are keenly aware that standardization is a strategy with specific costs and benefits that often yields overall market efficiency. Ken acknowledges creative assessment is more costly and contestable. Overall, it is not at all clear that standardized testing is a net loss for the economy or education system as a whole despite very real cases of loss for individuals in specific cases. Ken at best makes the case for the use of standard plus nonstandard assessment, but he hardly undercuts standard assessments utility. Ironically standard plus nonstandard assessment would lead to an increase in overall assessment time, which he is generally opposed to, and nonstandard assessments are generally lengthier than standard ones. It’s not clear that acting out his recommendations would lead to the world he seems to desire.

Later in ch 7/8 is some discussion about how standardization itself may not be a dirty word, but simply the US implementation thereof. That even the lauded finissh system standardizes, but they do so differently 

Gpa should be considered when advising kids on college

In the last third of ch 7/8, Ken discusses the learning record, which is a alternative assessment scheme similar to a portfolio plus principled portfolio grading.

Chapter 9/10 is about the parents role in education. I wonder if household situation matters more than the parental situation. Bc some post secondary learners don’t live with parents. Maybe average household education or adult education is a helpful factor. But also I think parental situation matters eg birth parents married or married non birth parents, single parent, same sex, adopted, diceased, etc. parental engagement matters in college or high school completion, no reason it shouldn’t also assist with alt education success. But this effect is already largely captured within the letter grade. Does class rank work better than letter grade?

Towards the end of ch 9/10, the last fifth, Ken seems to speak highly of homeschooling. He calls it the highest form of parental involvement and notes that 3% of students were homeschooled in 2011/2012 school year. Interesting question: what’s best - self directed education or parental involvement? Perhaps there is no contradiction at all...typical caveats like it may stunt socialization...but does it? Where is the research on this?

Ch 10/11 is about public policy... less interesting for my objective which is optimal individual planning. Interesting to note his assumptions completely rule out full privatization before the conversation even begins. What about a homeschooling mandate? Yet he already noted that national bodies are resistant to homeschooling despite its high quality product, not even mentioning its cost efficiency which he doesn’t consider. Generally, a problem in the book is that he doesn’t pay attention to costs. Saying things like real time data is a benefit is obvious. Saying programs built with this data can achieve better results is obvious. Saying it’s the best available use of public or private money is both non obvious and not seriously addressed by Ken 

Non rigorous statements like “it’s essential to have high standards and a collaborative process to decide what those standards should be” may sound good but they easily lead to self defeat and they are without evidence. In short, they aren’t true. It’s like indulging social desirability bias rather than actually helping anyone. But then these are the content of many policy conversations, not just kens view

Around 39 minute mark, Ken states that no category of alternative model of school such as private or charter has been shown to be better than a “well supported” public school. Of course this is wrong. Charters and private schools are more cost efficient, which means for any level of funding the better result would come from the non public school. Funding is what he means by support. In any case the argument for one category is disengenuous. We know personalizes learning is best and no one category is best for all groups. The obvious solution is public choice: allow them all. If or when the public schools flounder, exactly as they have done historically when choice is introduced, they will reveal themselves as comparatively weak, low quality, expensive, fragile, and non adaptable institutions.

1 - sound check
2 - thanks for meeting! i hope you've been well
3 - I have a agenda to keep us on track, but first wanted to ask if u had any comments or items of discussion beforehand*
	- he did have comments, notes below.
4 - cover letter, overarching plan
	- dissertation-by-publication; three papers = dissertation. get 1 done at a time.
	- concrete degree-to-alternative maps
	- measure student and employer oppenness in general and in particular, ROI impacts vs college degree
5 - actual lit review, plan to extend

Notes:
- dissertations don't look like this
- journal of econ literature: only lit reviews. find a journal publishing what we like..."that's his book report"
	- fleshing this out and reformatting, plus much more reading, could result in a publishable lit review
	- but, this doesn't work as a dissertation chapter. modern way to lit review is to discuss in passing, integrated with paper text; not serially in a dedicated section
- fix the section on nathan young; don't say 'shake' or 'slight' and notice he had very high motivation
- section 9 "won't move the needle" rising acceptability of bootcamps in CS...
	- text of point he is addressing pasted:
		"As discussed in the section 10, On A New U, bootcamps provide nearly one third of the number of
		computer science graduates that universities collectively provide. It is implausible to argue that
		such large numbers of non-traditional learners entering the workplace will not move the needle on
		what counts as normal. Employers are extremely satisfied with bootcamp gradautes, and most claim
		that bootcamp graduates are just as qualified as university graduates."
	- Bryan says this could form an interesting paper could form a paper, although prob more interesting in industrial psychology than economics
	- In saying 'attitudes on alt learning for comp sci changing could form a paper,' Bryan acknowledges this could relate to the attitudinal survey
	- another approach he recommends: interview 50 employers (3 topics bootcamps...2 other topics, figure that out)
- show him the survey...t = 3... main issue is surveying over...traditional 100k survey for journal...check with journals.
	- he seemed to indicate t = 3 wasn't good, and also it wasn't needed.
	- run the right survey once and you are covered; show him this survey ASAP. min 300 samples.
	- put in 'stuff on ability testing as an employment tool'
	- look for existing data sources...field is called industrial psychology...read more...email people working in there
- important thing is to network!
	- email people a question about their work. come back in a few weeks to ask for something if needed, eg review my paper or share data
	- cultivate network of people; every tenure track prof on econ of education... email a few (or 30!) each weeks
- Spring Goal...1 publishable piece, and a well crafted survey
	- well crafted survey complete by end of spring... do survey, start 
	- three interesting topics
