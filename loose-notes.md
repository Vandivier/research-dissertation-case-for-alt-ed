College unbound notes
Chapter one towards the end, about 25 minute mark, this author agrees with Kaplan in disagrees with Christiansen in that he sees government forces providing universities with a barrier against market forces and so he does not agree that universities will simply disappeared.

Jeff thinks many use universities will adapt. He also agrees that the bundled service model of university is collapsing.This is a major theme of the book and it’s exactly what he means by unbound. It’s sort of makes Kaplan’s wager out to be like a miss guided wager.

This book also seems then on data, but Rich and qualitative notes. In chapter 2, Jeff notices the futility of many universities seeking to educate for jobs that do not yet exist. He notices for example that the that three majors I think it is in the top 10 today didn’t exist in 1990. Something like that. He also notes many universities creating vocational – sounding degrees like athletic training or graphic design. This is another sign of ongoing disruption, or, adaptation. Project management as a masters degree is another example of a vocational degree, at this time at the graduate level. The p.m. I Institute is well known for certifying project managers. That would make the PMI credential an alternative credential. But now there are degrees which are officially accredited by PMI. This again indicates a sort of hybrid solution rather than a market flip.


In chapter 3 Jeff notices a powershift in the classroom from professor to student. This is a soft change or an attitude and of shift but stone important one. In this chapter Jeff notes that spending in non-learning services such as food and even like pools four students increased much faster than spending on teachers. So when someone purchases or university degree and the traditional system the density of learning is reduced this way. So an adaptive university will cut down on these expenses and increase learning spending

In chapter 3 Jeff notes that psalm majors cost the University rather than making the University money. Specifically he states that chemistry has been subsidized as long as chemistry has been taught. Interestingly, chemistry is considered a privately and socially beneficial major. I wonder if the fact that it subsidized has implications for Kaplan’s calculations.

I think it’s worth noting that when many students enter college their brains are not fully developed. Also I think many of them don’t understand the value of a dollar because they haven’t worked much. This allows them to except dad without really understanding at a volitional level or at at a deeper level how much debt they’re really getting into. Working a bit before going to school would help in either of these cases

Summarize chapter 5, Jeff does a good job of describing for forces that improve alternative credential programs, but the description is too wordy so needs to be some rice.

Salcon is described as a disruptor but he’s also partnering with universities, so it’s not as if he’s necessarily advocating alternative, I think is very much open to like working together

Chapter 5 gives some reasons that the traditional professor is losing power to the students. Chapter 6 highlights the fact that flipping the classroom is a key alternative pedagogy which goes hand-in-hand with current technological advances. As a third when flipping the classroom effectively outsources some of the teaching labor 2 students which drives self-directed learning and cuts teaching costs. None of these are really taken to be decisive reasons for alternative credentials to replace traditional credentials. No one even Kaplan, Thinks that traditional institutions have nothing to learn from alternative institutions. But these are places where synthesis or adaptation is already taking place. Traditional institutions are increasingly leveraging technology’s and flipped classroom pedagogy.

Occasionally books like college unbound engage in plausible reasoning the likes of which might make some empirical economists cringe. For example in chapter 6, Jeff states if match.com can make two people fall in love then we can design a better college experience through technology.

Traditional degree cost is somewhat understated because the average degree recipients holds more credits then required for graduation. According to chapter 6 in college and bound for the associates degree this is like 19 credits in for the Bashelors it is 16.


Check out degree compress Kors recommendations software. For part of my dissertation and or for part of a book which I may write as a result of this research, hey section should be devoted to optimizing advice for the student who does decide that the traditional route is best. Degree compass and things like intelligent university selection and things like intelligent professor in course selection and things like utilizing cheap or free online software to assist in studying to facilitate pass rate and other things like that may all be helpful


In chapter 6, Jeff suggests that many college freshman decide on a major based on the recommendations of a relative. This sort of indecision seems less like a student who is intentionally exploring and has intentionally reserves deciding to that point. It sounds more like someone who is uninformed or open to suggestions. This may indicate higher levels of openness at a younger age, which is consistent with the broader literature. So suggesting major shifts maybe effective to younger people Or people hire an open Ness. So my research need not assume that people will not change their majors, indeed it seems like this is already something to college and tag people are aware of. Jeff says he will talk more about it in chapter 8.

In chapter 7, Jeff compares online learning to online news media which disrupted the print media industry. This is a common go to for disruptors, but it also shows that alternatives do not directly substitute for traditional solutions. The major traditional news media sources still exist today however they adopted and evolved. The market in general for print media consolidated but it did not go away and media is still a big thing today. So we can expect the traditional credentialing system to consolidate and evolveBut not to go away I think this is a great synthesis of the disrupting camp and the robots traditional institution can buy Kaplan.

But not to go away I think this is a great Synthesis of the disrupter camp and the robust traditional institution camp


In chapter 7, Jeff finally takes traditional college institution credit on and ahead on fashion. He says one of the main current problems at the time of his writing is the failure of moves space MOOCS space to deliver academic credit. He says I doubt this will be a problem much longer as MOOCS continue to partner with universities.

In chapter 7 Jeff states that 40% of college freshman require remedial course work. This is in addition to typical credits like 120 credits. So this inflates some estimates of college cost. These expenses can be easily identified prior to enrollment and can group students into different buckets. So average student cost may be more than necessary student costs even had a traditional University.

In chapter 7, Jeff calculates the revenue from an undergraduate class at George Mason University. He calculates for principles of economics 103 by Boudreau. He calculates that this course brings in at least $420,000 and that is assuming they are all Virginia residents where a Virginia resident pays something like $1400 and an out-of-state student pay something like $3600. That is as of the year of writing of this book I’m not sure what year that is. So in today’s money this is I believe Over half $1 million. Diaz Kaplan in clued this money and his calculation of social cost? Space for each class that is converted from this sort of class into a free online course or cheap online course there is approximately half $1 million in social gain if I’m thinking about the problem correctly. Actually it may raise it even further if the online learning is more affective, which seems to be the case based on generalized information about online learning, but also due to specific information in chapter 7 given by Sebastian through this case where students would take his in person class and his online class simultaneously they would skip class learn from the online class and then obtain even better results on the test

Chapter 8 discusses a program called StraighterLine. Look into this as an alternative path education.

Maybe I should focus less on alternative education and more on affective education? My book can be called the case for education with Claire reference to Kaplan. The idea here is to test everything and hold onto the good, where traditional education must have some good because it’s a robust institution. The question becomes what’s good about it.

According to chapter 823% of students from families with over $100,000 of annual income attended to communicate with each up from 12% five years ago.

In chapter 8 Jeff discusses a competency based degree plan supposed to credit our best degree plan and apparently New Hampshire Ave. see you and Western Governors are trying to target $2500 per year for a four year degree under this plan. Sorry, southern New Hampshire. Leblanc at Snh apparently considers himself a disruptionist and considers online learning old news, that competency based education is the new disruption, and that the method will be through existing institutions, and it won’t replace 4 year programs it will be a new service and additional revenue stream

Create a list of 5 to 10 notable data sources about higher education and also alternative education of possible although I don’t think those exist although maybe some niche things like charter schools and private schools homeschooling on schooling and so forth maybe those neck things have associated surveys. One for Hyridge Acacian is the national survey of like college student engagement. Another I think it’s called like the ACL American commute or ACS American community survey something like that. One of the later chapters in college I’m down like 56 or seven discusses standardized measurements of Hyridge Acacian outcomes I think it Chapter 7 or eight actually maybe chapter 9 or 10

In chapter 10, Jeff states that an important measure of active learning is called time on task. Active learning has been shown more effective than traditional learning methods including lecture. Time on task indicates time that a student is actively working on in the same task for the purposes of learning. What this means is that jobs or career work is nearly 100% time on task and therefore can be considered active learning. So working is literally a form of learning so the Decotah me between work and school is a false economy. Schooling can be viewed as work with a zero or negative wage and possibly with different products at work.

Contact Kevin Currie Knight about my research, discuss his self directed learning live stream, will it be available, would he consider referring me for humane studies?

* competency = capability = skill

In chapter 11 Jeff discusses a company called on sure which takes under employed workers in the United States and employees them mainly apparently an IT jobs. He says it similar to an apprenticeship but they are working with universities to get college credit for their training at on sure. Germany has common apprenticeship programs and this results historically in faster job placement for Germans compared to US college grads

In the second half of chapter 11 Jeff criticizes some modes of economic analysis of the value of an education. I think he does so unsuccessfully and most of his points are either empirically questionable and importance or else Marshal addressed by Kaplan. He also defines alternative education a skip in college entirely and says he is an opponent of it.


In chapter 13 Jeff goes over a short list of recommended/innovative universities. This information should be included in my section on advising students for whom a traditional school is a good fit


In chapter 14 Jeff discusses lake community cop college wake forest which gives both high school credit and two years of college credit and four or five years of schooling. I think they can also produce like health certifications or something. He says this is part of the early college movement so look into that. This route can shorten college time by a couple years so that would obviously improve return on investment.

This also indicates that your college activities and college optimizing plans go back before senior year of high school and even into middle school perhaps earlier than that I’m not sure but if we were to create a tool which advised parents or students to optimally plan one of the questions we need to be like what age are you and it would need to give different advice if the person was still early in high school or before high school because choosing the high school can provide credit towards college

In fact there are so many diverse programs at the college out level and also in high school and before that that’s one thing which can be done in addition to the 30 concrete plans is a variable methodology for value assessment which is more like a checklist of things for the student with a parent to investigate and then it leaves the investigation work to that parent or student rather than the analyst. But it should eventually result in an apples to apples comparison of return on investment

In chapter 14 Jeff notes Westminster College requires the creation of a digital portfolio for all students beginning with the freshman class of 2011. This highlights that even send me a traditional universities see value in a portfolio of demonstrated learning. This adds to the discussion on whether a portfolio is simultaneously a work product and they work Cygnal which I think it is

In chapter 15 Jeff mentions the American Council on education credit service which is a service that is able to evaluate I guess like tasks done outside the classroom for the purposes of college credit

I wonder if colleges would be open to evaluating church attendance as academic credit for religious studies or like evidence-based church participation such as proven membership with a church for number of years or something. Also get hub portfolios and work experience including things like just like working at the store which may not necessarily be connected to the degree.

I think kids these days in middle school and high school should absolutely be establishing a digital portfolio and then they can choose what to do with that portfolio because it could be used for academic credit as well as present it to employers so that even if the student is not able to go directly to work they haven’t wasted their time and there is some chance they could go directly to work it’s a win-win in either case

I wonder how common is it for high schools to allow an elective class or something like that to students who create such a digital portfolio said that they might even be able to get three benefits for the price of one

Beginning notes for Creative schools Mike and Robinson. In chapter 1 he defines education which is like obvious and useful although the previous two books they didn’t do that also his definition of education is more broad in scope and ends up actually contradicting the definition used by Kaplan.

In chapter 2 highlights a connection between personalized learning and passion. As Kevin Carey night notes and also Angela Duckworth great is composed of passion and perseverance both of them. There also seems to be an element of reciprocity in the smoky road story.

In chapter 2 can discuss his PISA, another standardized test in data source.

unrelated to book for a moment; in my own research I showed that people who are more familiar with alt creds tend to favor them and have a higher chance of saying they work for entry level position and are good for society overall. In my limited temporal sample I've yet to see awareness is growing, but the books seem to indicate awareness is growing. New thought: use Google Trends!

Side note - does caplan acknowledge endogeneity between public policy ie funding and conformity value? Eg it’s conformity signaling bc everyone does it and everyone does it bc it’s cheap, so when u take public subsidy away it will in fact reduce the conformity signal value

Prepare 5 questions for caplan as a separate artifact

Around the middle of chapter 5, Ken indicates that he sees ikioo as a Nero week measure of intelligence intelligence. He indicates that he is a fan of the theory of multiple intelligence.

Later in chapter 5 he speaks highly of self-directed learning and play for children in elementary school and ostensibly otherwise. He name dropped Peter Gray affably.

About a quarter through chapter 6, can discuss his progressive versus traditional teaching. He claims progressive teaching or progressive learning is constituted of self discovery and group activities it’s sort of seems like active learning to me. Where traditional learning would be a lecture.

Can states the distinction between These two is more theoretical than real, and in practice mode most teachers do and should use both. For 10, having a good teacher is a critical piece of learning experience. Just after describing the difference between progressive and traditional education, Ken gives four qualities of an expert teacher. It seems that Kenst conception of the teacher is other than the individual which makes it strange to discuss self learning and I can Stijl frame work

Towards the middle of Chapter 6 10 references Braxton to talk about a concept called building learning power BLP. This seems to be a learning how to learn paradigm were there some sort of accumulation of something called learning power was just sort of like a stock or a capital of some sort.

Around the middle of Chapter 6 can discuss his mastery learning. I don’t think Kaplan adjusts fade out calculations for whether or not the learning was mastery best or not.

34-35 minutes into chapter 6, Ken Robinson discusses how flipped classrooms cause better outcomes. So pedagogies are often causally responsible, not merely asssociated, with outcomes. He actually does cite a paper on this topic. At 35:01, saying, there was a paper in the late 90s where peer instruction lead to results standard deviations higher than those in traditional courses. He says other studies have shown similarly dramatic results. In 2012
