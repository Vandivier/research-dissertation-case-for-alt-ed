College unbound notes
Chapter one towards the end, about 25 minute mark, this author agrees with Kaplan in disagrees with Christiansen in that he sees government forces providing universities with a barrier against market forces and so he does not agree that universities will simply disappeared.

Jeff thinks many use universities will adapt. He also agrees that the bundled service model of university is collapsing.This is a major theme of the book and it’s exactly what he means by unbound. It’s sort of makes Kaplan’s wager out to be like a miss guided wager.

This book also seems then on data, but Rich and qualitative notes. In chapter 2, Jeff notices the futility of many universities seeking to educate for jobs that do not yet exist. He notices for example that the that three majors I think it is in the top 10 today didn’t exist in 1990. Something like that. He also notes many universities creating vocational – sounding degrees like athletic training or graphic design. This is another sign of ongoing disruption, or, adaptation. Project management as a masters degree is another example of a vocational degree, at this time at the graduate level. The p.m. I Institute is well known for certifying project managers. That would make the PMI credential an alternative credential. But now there are degrees which are officially accredited by PMI. This again indicates a sort of hybrid solution rather than a market flip.


In chapter 3 Jeff notices a powershift in the classroom from professor to student. This is a soft change or an attitude and of shift but stone important one. In this chapter Jeff notes that spending in non-learning services such as food and even like pools four students increased much faster than spending on teachers. So when someone purchases or university degree and the traditional system the density of learning is reduced this way. So an adaptive university will cut down on these expenses and increase learning spending

In chapter 3 Jeff notes that psalm majors cost the University rather than making the University money. Specifically he states that chemistry has been subsidized as long as chemistry has been taught. Interestingly, chemistry is considered a privately and socially beneficial major. I wonder if the fact that it subsidized has implications for Kaplan’s calculations.

I think it’s worth noting that when many students enter college their brains are not fully developed. Also I think many of them don’t understand the value of a dollar because they haven’t worked much. This allows them to except dad without really understanding at a volitional level or at at a deeper level how much debt they’re really getting into. Working a bit before going to school would help in either of these cases

Summarize chapter 5, Jeff does a good job of describing for forces that improve alternative credential programs, but the description is too wordy so needs to be some rice.

Salcon is described as a disruptor but he’s also partnering with universities, so it’s not as if he’s necessarily advocating alternative, I think is very much open to like working together

Chapter 5 gives some reasons that the traditional professor is losing power to the students. Chapter 6 highlights the fact that flipping the classroom is a key alternative pedagogy which goes hand-in-hand with current technological advances. As a third when flipping the classroom effectively outsources some of the teaching labor 2 students which drives self-directed learning and cuts teaching costs. None of these are really taken to be decisive reasons for alternative credentials to replace traditional credentials. No one even Kaplan, Thinks that traditional institutions have nothing to learn from alternative institutions. But these are places where synthesis or adaptation is already taking place. Traditional institutions are increasingly leveraging technology’s and flipped classroom pedagogy.

Occasionally books like college unbound engage in plausible reasoning the likes of which might make some empirical economists cringe. For example in chapter 6, Jeff states if match.com can make two people fall in love then we can design a better college experience through technology.

Traditional degree cost is somewhat understated because the average degree recipients holds more credits then required for graduation. According to chapter 6 in college and bound for the associates degree this is like 19 credits in for the Bashelors it is 16.


Check out degree compress Kors recommendations software. For part of my dissertation and or for part of a book which I may write as a result of this research, hey section should be devoted to optimizing advice for the student who does decide that the traditional route is best. Degree compass and things like intelligent university selection and things like intelligent professor in course selection and things like utilizing cheap or free online software to assist in studying to facilitate pass rate and other things like that may all be helpful


In chapter 6, Jeff suggests that many college freshman decide on a major based on the recommendations of a relative. This sort of indecision seems less like a student who is intentionally exploring and has intentionally reserves deciding to that point. It sounds more like someone who is uninformed or open to suggestions. This may indicate higher levels of openness at a younger age, which is consistent with the broader literature. So suggesting major shifts maybe effective to younger people Or people hire an open Ness. So my research need not assume that people will not change their majors, indeed it seems like this is already something to college and tag people are aware of. Jeff says he will talk more about it in chapter 8.

In chapter 7, Jeff compares online learning to online news media which disrupted the print media industry. This is a common go to for disruptors, but it also shows that alternatives do not directly substitute for traditional solutions. The major traditional news media sources still exist today however they adopted and evolved. The market in general for print media consolidated but it did not go away and media is still a big thing today. So we can expect the traditional credentialing system to consolidate and evolveBut not to go away I think this is a great synthesis of the disrupting camp and the robots traditional institution can buy Kaplan.

But not to go away I think this is a great Synthesis of the disrupter camp and the robust traditional institution camp


In chapter 7, Jeff finally takes traditional college institution credit on and ahead on fashion. He says one of the main current problems at the time of his writing is the failure of moves space MOOCS space to deliver academic credit. He says I doubt this will be a problem much longer as MOOCS continue to partner with universities.

In chapter 7 Jeff states that 40% of college freshman require remedial course work. This is in addition to typical credits like 120 credits. So this inflates some estimates of college cost. These expenses can be easily identified prior to enrollment and can group students into different buckets. So average student cost may be more than necessary student costs even had a traditional University.

In chapter 7, Jeff calculates the revenue from an undergraduate class at George Mason University. He calculates for principles of economics 103 by Boudreau. He calculates that this course brings in at least $420,000 and that is assuming they are all Virginia residents where a Virginia resident pays something like $1400 and an out-of-state student pay something like $3600. That is as of the year of writing of this book I’m not sure what year that is. So in today’s money this is I believe Over half $1 million. Diaz Kaplan in clued this money and his calculation of social cost? Space for each class that is converted from this sort of class into a free online course or cheap online course there is approximately half $1 million in social gain if I’m thinking about the problem correctly. Actually it may raise it even further if the online learning is more affective, which seems to be the case based on generalized information about online learning, but also due to specific information in chapter 7 given by Sebastian through this case where students would take his in person class and his online class simultaneously they would skip class learn from the online class and then obtain even better results on the test

Chapter 8 discusses a program called StraighterLine. Look into this as an alternative path education.

Maybe I should focus less on alternative education and more on affective education? My book can be called the case for education with Claire reference to Kaplan. The idea here is to test everything and hold onto the good, where traditional education must have some good because it’s a robust institution. The question becomes what’s good about it.

According to chapter 823% of students from families with over $100,000 of annual income attended to communicate with each up from 12% five years ago.

In chapter 8 Jeff discusses a competency based degree plan supposed to credit our best degree plan and apparently New Hampshire Ave. see you and Western Governors are trying to target $2500 per year for a four year degree under this plan. Sorry, southern New Hampshire. Leblanc at Snh apparently considers himself a disruptionist and considers online learning old news, that competency based education is the new disruption, and that the method will be through existing institutions, and it won’t replace 4 year programs it will be a new service and additional revenue stream

Create a list of 5 to 10 notable data sources about higher education and also alternative education of possible although I don’t think those exist although maybe some niche things like charter schools and private schools homeschooling on schooling and so forth maybe those neck things have associated surveys. One for Hyridge Acacian is the national survey of like college student engagement. Another I think it’s called like the ACL American commute or ACS American community survey something like that. One of the later chapters in college I’m down like 56 or seven discusses standardized measurements of Hyridge Acacian outcomes I think it Chapter 7 or eight actually maybe chapter 9 or 10

In chapter 10, Jeff states that an important measure of active learning is called time on task. Active learning has been shown more effective than traditional learning methods including lecture. Time on task indicates time that a student is actively working on in the same task for the purposes of learning. What this means is that jobs or career work is nearly 100% time on task and therefore can be considered active learning. So working is literally a form of learning so the Decotah me between work and school is a false economy. Schooling can be viewed as work with a zero or negative wage and possibly with different products at work.

In chapter 11 Jeff discusses a company called on sure which takes under employed workers in the United States and employees them mainly apparently an IT jobs. He says it similar to an apprenticeship but they are working with universities to get college credit for their training at on sure. Germany has common apprenticeship programs and this results historically in faster job placement for Germans compared to US college grads

In the second half of chapter 11 Jeff criticizes some modes of economic analysis of the value of an education. I think he does so unsuccessfully and most of his points are either empirically questionable and importance or else Marshal addressed by Kaplan. He also defines alternative education a skip in college entirely and says he is an opponent of it.


In chapter 13 Jeff goes over a short list of recommended/innovative universities. This information should be included in my section on advising students for whom a traditional school is a good fit


In chapter 14 Jeff discusses lake community cop college wake forest which gives both high school credit and two years of college credit and four or five years of schooling. I think they can also produce like health certifications or something. He says this is part of the early college movement so look into that. This route can shorten college time by a couple years so that would obviously improve return on investment.

This also indicates that your college activities and college optimizing plans go back before senior year of high school and even into middle school perhaps earlier than that I’m not sure but if we were to create a tool which advised parents or students to optimally plan one of the questions we need to be like what age are you and it would need to give different advice if the person was still early in high school or before high school because choosing the high school can provide credit towards college

In fact there are so many diverse programs at the college out level and also in high school and before that that’s one thing which can be done in addition to the 30 concrete plans is a variable methodology for value assessment which is more like a checklist of things for the student with a parent to investigate and then it leaves the investigation work to that parent or student rather than the analyst. But it should eventually result in an apples to apples comparison of return on investment

In chapter 14 Jeff notes Westminster College requires the creation of a digital portfolio for all students beginning with the freshman class of 2011. This highlights that even send me a traditional universities see value in a portfolio of demonstrated learning. This adds to the discussion on whether a portfolio is simultaneously a work product and they work Cygnal which I think it is

In chapter 15 Jeff mentions the American Council on education credit service which is a service that is able to evaluate I guess like tasks done outside the classroom for the purposes of college credit

I wonder if colleges would be open to evaluating church attendance as academic credit for religious studies or like evidence-based church participation such as proven membership with a church for number of years or something. Also get hub portfolios and work experience including things like just like working at the store which may not necessarily be connected to the degree.

I think kids these days in middle school and high school should absolutely be establishing a digital portfolio and then they can choose what to do with that portfolio because it could be used for academic credit as well as present it to employers so that even if the student is not able to go directly to work they haven’t wasted their time and there is some chance they could go directly to work it’s a win-win in either case

I wonder how common is it for high schools to allow an elective class or something like that to students who create such a digital portfolio said that they might even be able to get three benefits for the price of one

Beginning notes for Creative schools Mike and Robinson. In chapter 1 he defines education which is like obvious and useful although the previous two books they didn’t do that also his definition of education is more broad in scope and ends up actually contradicting the definition used by Kaplan.

In chapter 2 highlights a connection between personalized learning and passion. As Kevin Carey night notes and also Angela Duckworth great is composed of passion and perseverance both of them. There also seems to be an element of reciprocity in the smoky road story.

In chapter 2 can discuss his PISA, another standardized test in data source.

Side note - does caplan acknowledge endogeneity between public policy ie funding and conformity value? Eg it’s conformity signaling bc everyone does it and everyone does it bc it’s cheap, so when u take public subsidy away it will in fact reduce the conformity signal value

Around the middle of chapter 5, Ken indicates that he sees ikioo as a Nero week measure of intelligence intelligence. He indicates that he is a fan of the theory of multiple intelligence.

Later in chapter 5 he speaks highly of self-directed learning and play for children in elementary school and ostensibly otherwise. He name dropped Peter Gray affably.

About a quarter through chapter 6, can discuss his progressive versus traditional teaching. He claims progressive teaching or progressive learning is constituted of self discovery and group activities it’s sort of seems like active learning to me. Where traditional learning would be a lecture.

Can states the distinction between These two is more theoretical than real, and in practice mode most teachers do and should use both. For 10, having a good teacher is a critical piece of learning experience. Just after describing the difference between progressive and traditional education, Ken gives four qualities of an expert teacher. It seems that Kenst conception of the teacher is other than the individual which makes it strange to discuss self learning and I can Stijl frame work

Towards the middle of Chapter 6 10 references Braxton to talk about a concept called building learning power BLP. This seems to be a learning how to learn paradigm were there some sort of accumulation of something called learning power was just sort of like a stock or a capital of some sort.

Around the middle of Chapter 6 can discuss his mastery learning. I don’t think Kaplan adjusts fade out calculations for whether or not the learning was mastery best or not.

34-35 minutes into chapter 6, Ken Robinson discusses how flipped classrooms cause better outcomes. So pedagogies are often causally responsible, not merely asssociated, with outcomes. He actually does cite a paper on this topic. At 35:01, saying, there was a paper in the late 90s where peer instruction lead to results standard deviations higher than those in traditional courses. He says other studies have shown similarly dramatic results. In 2012 

# related to idk what
In chapter 3 Chan has a section specifically on so called alternative education. He knows that these are programs designed for students who are having trouble in school or have altogether dropped out. This is worn out and some of the academic literature on the topic of alternative education. This is a an example of what I’m not talking about when I talk about alternative education. So perhaps I need a different term notably the alternative education can refers to often coincides with low performing students. It sometimes coincides with Entech or innovative approaches to education, but the goal is to enable low performance students. In contrast when I discuss alternative education, I’m very interested in how to unlock the potential of high-performing students. I’m not simply interested in facilitating learning for low performing students, although that is interesting, but I am interested equally in allowing high-performing students to reach they were highs that they would never have seen under the traditional model.

Perhaps, Non-traditional education is a better word for my use case compared to alternative education.

I could perhaps even utilize an Autre term a more odd term to really distinguish my definition and perhaps bring some positive connotation. For example progressive education or something else like that. Or innovative education or new education. Something that has a semantic appeal to facilitate marketing, Tiffany still take normalization, and to undercut conscious or unconscious bias which would inhibit adoption or a pose my views. It very well may deserve a section of a paper on a note about semantics.

# more evernote dump, finishing UnBound and returning to Craig

Ch6 39 min mark he discusses creativity, imagination, and innovation in a sensible way. He basically calls it applies innovation and goes through some myths such as it’s only ties to art or only certain people have it and it can’t be taught or developed

During the last 20 minutes of chapter 6, 10 talks about the centrality of inspiring students. This seems to be the reverse of the student having grit. GRIT. This seems to be like in Dowing grit or training grit. This relates to something Kaplan talked about when he said inspirational teaching can be valuable intrinsically as American good. 410, some of this is charisma on the part of the teacher and some of this inspiration comes from relatable material. Passion or inspiration is the opposite of boredom and this beer, and nothing makes a topic more boring than being abstract to the point of not being practically usable or even understandable. One thing students became passionate about was music, in particular when they could use an iPad with a free GarageBand app so that they didn’t need to be technically skilled musicians but they can still create whatever music they wanted. Humor also plays a role. Another approach was to joke about farting and turn that into a lesson on chemistry and gases. While the notion of decomposing great into perseverance and ambition is interesting, things like shimmer and other things we can uncover in this investigation lead us to realize that passion may complement what is distinct from ambition.

As I Listen to the introduction of chapter 7, I realize that the audiobook considered the prelude a distinct chapter, so everything is one chapter off. What audible considers chapter 7, the text itself refers to as chapter 6. So prior to this note when I said chapter 6 I meant chapter 5

Early chapter 7 which is to say early chapter 6 does a good job of going over and I’ll turn it of pedagogy called project-based learning. This could be advertise a bowl to an employer because project-based learning as much in common with projectbased production that is many employers, particularly an IT and corporate setting, have projectbased production with project managers and so on. Of course this is not all employers, so part of a good education involves working backwards from a concrete set of employers not even just jobs but actually The employer.

I’m just going to go ahead and continue using the Audible chapters and I’ll correct for them at analysis time. In chapter 7 about 12 to 13 minutes and, Kim states that a recent move and education is to focus on what students should have in terms of capabilities as a result of their education. He says this is a good idea. This is exactly parallel what I think is a good idea when I say that we should work backwards not only from a profession but even from a specific employer. Similarly, specific classes should work backwards from Desired capabilities. When we say should we are proposing that this approach will lead to a higher quality for a lower price, but this does need to be proven and it does assumed that hire Kody for a lower price is better. But that’s not really controversial. Ken goes further than to state that capabilities as the proper ends and he actually states eight competencies which she thinks all students must end up with. I think this is substantially more controversial. He does not demonstrate hire chief meant being associated with these except through possible reasoning, and he leaves out quite a few important competencies in the job market, he also disregards that mini capabilities should be self selected by the students in other words Capability production should be individualized

On further reflection cans eight capabilities are even further controversial because some of them directly a pose what Caplan’s Argues that employers are looking for, such as being normalAnd conforming, which seems to be somewhat opposed to being creative and innovative. By the way I’m not arguing with Ken, I think the capabilities he names are very often cool, but he doesn’t very well prove the necessity of these and neither are they obviously what employers want, even if they are good for the purposes of human capital and real learning

Add about the 16 minute mark, can it gives a list of what is meant by critical thinking and that it is in excess of formal reasoning. This is interesting and relates to my conversation on Weather critical thinking is affectively detailed thinking. I think detailed thinking is different from what Ken has in mind, but Kenst seems to use many terms in his own way rather than in a way tradition of the literature

In chapter 710 of poses engagement to boredom. This seems kind of obvious but I’m not sure that connection has been made in the literature. So in this view passion become synonymous with or at least operationalized by engagement, so be sure to reference that link with papers.

Can also mix is public and private interest in his description of the egg capabilities all students should have for example one of them is being a good citizen which is inextricably intertwined to a functioning democracy according to Ken. However one this seems to be a social benefit not a private benefit and to this restricts his concepts of education only to the Society switch wish to maintain a democratic system.

He also engages additional argument without the use of evidence are in the use of superlative saying things like dance is the best way to understand another cultures are experience.


Cannot Robinson considers to be a science while other academics consider it to be a liberal art.

At the 33 minute mark ken discusses design thinking. This is a common paradigm in agile software development and also in professional design more broadly. Ken does a good job of emphasizing the importance of teaching entire modes of thinking and application over or equal to specific classes, facts, and skills. I wonder if learning by reasoning is more robust against fadeout and framework based learning is like a macrocosm of reasoning to a solution. Eg economic analysis or design thinking or agile planning, where knowledge of a new concept can fit inside of an existing framework, and sometimes the framework can even help or lead to the discovery of the new information. Anecdotally I’ve often found reasoning to an answer far easier than memorization

Kenst vans a large portion of the second half of chapter 7 because we are removing the distinction between classroom-based learning and Learn outside of the classroom. He emphasizes a pedagogical approach called big picture learning, which in turn emphasizes internship. He also sticks up for vocational learning

Chapter 7/8 is about testing. One teacher estimates standardized test prep requires about one month of work per year. The issues raised are the common issues and no innovative solutions are discussed. As economists often remark, obvious to our paradigm, it is not obvious that these tests are a net bad or a poor return on investment despite having some real costs. Ken states that there are two main problems, neither of which I consider claimed in a convincing way: 1, instead of becoming a means to better education, standardization has become an ends in itself, and 2) tests focus on limited forms of response, such as multiple choice, they don’t focus on what’s important, they eschew complexity or nuance, and they don’t account for situational factors on the part of the test taker

One of the few more serious issues raised in chapter 7/8 is that many schools and school districts are incentivized to locate hire attention to students near the cut off point for pass because their funding is tied to pass rates. As a result they may under educate both low performing and high-performing students and they also are anecdotally rumored to encourage strategic diagnosis of ADHD in some cases.

They were vary compliant, could easily follow direction, and their creativity were just about drained is a comment around 12 min mark in ch 8 regarding students as they prep for SAT. But then what if this is exactly what employers want? Again ken Robinson vs caplan on good education. Ken might well argue that employers should want creative employers, but the distinction between an ideal education system and an ideal education system contingent on the actual labor market is not well made in kens work

In chapter 8 Ken reminds us again of both his insights and blindspots. He correctly reminds us that GPA is a better predictor of college completion than sat scores, but he also goes further citing someone who says that sat scores measure nothing of value, seemingly ignoring the fact that sat scores measure iq fairly well and correlate with life success. Ken emphasizes that he isn’t rejecting the need for assessment but he is complaining about the form assessment now takes. He seems to be particularly critical of standardized and high stakes testing. Clearly such tests have a role as low stakes testing is ineffective (eg performance is better predicted on incentivized tests while non incentivized tests are noisy, high stakes are effectively high incentive) and something like personalized, as opposed to standardized, testing would be useful for self-to-self comparison but not cross-individual comparison. Among education scholars it is popular to talk negatively about standardization, but economists are keenly aware that standardization is a strategy with specific costs and benefits that often yields overall market efficiency. Ken acknowledges creative assessment is more costly and contestable. Overall, it is not at all clear that standardized testing is a net loss for the economy or education system as a whole despite very real cases of loss for individuals in specific cases. Ken at best makes the case for the use of standard plus nonstandard assessment, but he hardly undercuts standard assessments utility. Ironically standard plus nonstandard assessment would lead to an increase in overall assessment time, which he is generally opposed to, and nonstandard assessments are generally lengthier than standard ones. It’s not clear that acting out his recommendations would lead to the world he seems to desire.

Later in ch 7/8 is some discussion about how standardization itself may not be a dirty word, but simply the US implementation thereof. That even the lauded finissh system standardizes, but they do so differently

In the last third of ch 7/8, Ken discusses the learning record, which is a alternative assessment scheme similar to a portfolio plus principled portfolio grading.

Chapter 9/10 is about the parents role in education. I wonder if household situation matters more than the parental situation. Bc some post secondary learners don’t live with parents. Maybe average household education or adult education is a helpful factor. But also I think parental situation matters eg birth parents married or married non birth parents, single parent, same sex, adopted, diceased, etc. parental engagement matters in college or high school completion, no reason it shouldn’t also assist with alt education success. But this effect is already largely captured within the letter grade. Does class rank work better than letter grade?

Towards the end of ch 9/10, the last fifth, Ken seems to speak highly of homeschooling. He calls it the highest form of parental involvement and notes that 3% of students were homeschooled in 2011/2012 school year. Interesting question: what’s best - self directed education or parental involvement? Perhaps there is no contradiction at all...typical caveats like it may stunt socialization...but does it? Where is the research on this?

Ch 10/11 is about public policy... less interesting for my objective which is optimal individual planning. Interesting to note his assumptions completely rule out full privatization before the conversation even begins. What about a homeschooling mandate? Yet he already noted that national bodies are resistant to homeschooling despite its high quality product, not even mentioning its cost efficiency which he doesn’t consider. Generally, a problem in the book is that he doesn’t pay attention to costs. Saying things like real time data is a benefit is obvious. Saying programs built with this data can achieve better results is obvious. Saying it’s the best available use of public or private money is both non obvious and not seriously addressed by Ken 

Non rigorous statements like “it’s essential to have high standards and a collaborative process to decide what those standards should be” may sound good but they easily lead to self defeat and they are without evidence. In short, they aren’t true. It’s like indulging social desirability bias rather than actually helping anyone. But then these are the content of many policy conversations, not just kens view

Around 39 minute mark, Ken states that no category of alternative model of school such as private or charter has been shown to be better than a “well supported” public school. Of course this is wrong. Charters and private schools are more cost efficient, which means for any level of funding the better result would come from the non public school. Funding is what he means by support. In any case the argument for one category is disengenuous. We know personalizes learning is best and no one category is best for all groups. The obvious solution is public choice: allow them all. If or when the public schools flounder, exactly as they have done historically when choice is introduced, they will reveal themselves as comparatively weak, low quality, expensive, fragile, and non adaptable institutions.

The afterword name drops interesting thinkers in education including Montessori and Steiner who lead to school approaches. He says these traditions tend to emphasize personali3: learning 

Ch 3 Craig’s book
 85% jobs posted online and 80% of employers use an application tracking system. These systems include functionality which ranks and filters candidates by keyword matching. These matching algorithms are known to have systematic accuracy problems. Check Burning glass research. Technical keywords have exploaded within jds as they are effective descriminators. Their use has highlighted a keyword-level skills gap. It’s not general but it’s to do with specific skills, within and without traditional it/development. The skills gap is particularly obvious at the entry level, meaning traditional education providers are not equipping students with skills

Craig states that using software can be considered a “middle skill,” while a higher level of proficiency is represented in being able to create or manipulate software. That is, programming skill. He refers to Robert Cohen at the economic strategy institute who states modern entry jobs require a noticeably high level of proficiency with software development. Burning Glass reported that 49% of jobs with a starting salary over 70k require programming skills. Many education reform advocates recommend allowing programming to substitute for a foreign language requirement, but why stop there? If people are consuming school in order to find gainful employment these days, why not prepare them for a career in programming by default? Setting defaults and expectations makes a huge difference. Many people complain about a career in programming because they think it’s too difficult or boring; myths which would be largely remedied simply by having these people actually try programming. Craig convincingly argues with multiple sources that IT roles are the highest paid, most in demand jobs in recent years including pure programming roles, specialty programming roles like artificial intelligence, and near-programming roles like data science and UX.

At loc 1097, Craig gives some reasons that institutions have been slow to adapt, or unable to satisfactorally provide these technical skills. Among other reasons he names faculty control and the nature of the credit hour itself. Key insight: upper level courses are largely dictated by faculty research interests, which are largely independent of labor market needs. Potential solution? Applied research which extends actual labor market concerns; this sort of research is frequently found within private firm R&d departments. Craig notes even highly relevant degrees like a BS in comp science is often far less applied than employers want.

Craig notes the uptrend in double majoring and attributes this behavior to a hedge on the part of students to hedge against unemployment due to misaligned curriculum 

Craig Also notes that it appears that university is not preparing graduates with soft or non-cognitive skills either. So basically, graduates are not ready with any of the skills and players one. It may be the case that having prior work experience is more helpful for developing soft skills than a university degree. For example teamwork, communication, and punctuality are all considered soft skills. These skills matter even in basic work like grocery store Cashier and so on which don’t even require a degree.

Loc 1157 has data on credential inflation; using masters in lieu of bachelors and the Burning Glass credential gap. Many 0-to-1 professions requiring degree. Craig echos caplan in asking whether more demanding jobs are a plausible cause and he echoes caplan in finding that jobs are easier, not harder.

Todo: maybe make a spreadsheet of key points and show where each book lands on this. Matrix or feature style instead of book by book.

Loc 1175 Craig refers to a working paper on experience inflation. For Craig, Bidwell’s empty quadrant is attributable to the low skill human product of the university education. Craig also notes the trend in jettisoning degree requirements altogether, a significant development largely discounted or ignored by the other scholars in the area, putting Craig to the right of even Christiansen on the degree-no degree spectrum 

Loc 1199 Discusses Ernst and Young battery of assessments; perhaps another alternative path? Is the traditional result really a credential or is it a job? Perhaps the college degree is neotraditional, not traditional. And the job is paleotraditional to isolate it as a subset of the whole of traditional which includes both neo and paleo. E&y’s move resulted in a diversity increase - an espoused goal among many would-be policy changers. Penguin Random House and Nestle also. Nestle found 20% of new hires would not have even gotten an interview. Also IBM. I’m sure I could find more such employers by looking around. This would just be a roundabout approach to measuring the total jobs which don’t require a degree. As I’ve said previously, at the individual level it’s easy to handle: work with a recruiter or get an interaction then get hired off experience.

loose notes end with Loc 1199 Discusses Ernst and Young battery of assessments
 
Location 1226 Craig know it’s a hard research Associates survey in which 80% of employers with the sample size of 400 indicated that it would be Very or fairly useful to see an electronic portfolio of work

loc 1229 2013 survey, 71% of employers said they would consider hiring a candidate without a degree over another candidate with a degree

loc 1237, Chapter 3 key points: "Deteriorating employment outcomes...are primarily a result of changes in the hiring process". Note: I say employers are the key to change, it's actually reassuring that they are already driving changes and more open to change perhaps than university (although they arguably haven't changed enough on average but a microeconomic actor needn't really worry about the average too much and some universities are making cool changes)

GE fridge story in Ch 4, another example of a possibly funny possibly relatable, low-density on facts, not academic sounding. concept of the last mile introduced around loc 1274

Loc 1298, “most student-pay bootcamps show placement rates north of 80%” also interesting thing about risk; many last-mile options offer employment or income guarantees, so the risk-adjusted income is even higher for most people and particularly high for risk sensitive people. Interesting because some perceive alternative education as a risky endeavor, partly bc it is abnormal therefore not tried and true

Loc 1309 alt Ed is more technical than traditional Ed; indicates different tools for different purposes rather than substitutes. But technical is the right tool for the purpose of specific employment. Liberal arts or nontechnical might be preferable for generAl but not particular employment...in theory anyway, in practice it may not be comparatively better for either

4 of Craig’s 6 last mile traits I agree with

Loc 1383, 57% of colleges and universities are blaming the likes of software coding bootcamps for declines in enrollment

Loc 1432, ch 4, coding camps 4 weeks to 2 years, 14 weeks average. Time cost should be considered in education cost. Loc 1439: 95 coding schools as of this year, started in 2012. Now graduate about one third as university comp sci. 80 percent plus placement rate is within 6 months. 99.8% employers that have hired plan to hire more: 72 percent say equally qualified compared to school and 12 percent say better

Loc 1568 bootcamps outside of coding. Gen assembly has UX and product management, PrepMD for medical, (Jessie, Katie, others: would  you be more likely to do prepmd over coding bootcamp or 1 -2 year online bio or nursing degree?)

Lots of anecdotes eg ch 4 contribute both to the no academic relatability and also to low info density.

Loc 1626 what is Besomebody Paths? Dental, sales, culinary, auto? AlwaysHired sales. Can top college degrees all match to a bootcamp? Medical Sales College.

Ch 6, loc 1845: at what point does a last mile program become a viable alternative to college? Ch 5 many are intended as top up programs, but ch 6 24% enter with no degree. Loc the 1911, college mvp includes cog and non cognitive skill development over last mile program...but is it even good at that?? Can better training on those be found elsewhere?

Loc 1923: financing of alt Ed vs traditional Ed...alt financing can sometimes be used for traditional Ed too tho. Eg income share agreement is dischargeable w bankruptcy

Loc 2068 Craig refers to Christiansen institute. College mvp is a real thing distinct from bootcamp or certificTion etc. not accredited.

Loc 2132... what industries are covered by apprenticeship?? Digital is well covered but what else. Also loc 2140. Looks like internship to me. Blue color union stuff mostly like plumber. Apprenticeship service provider is popular in uk, not USA. WhiteHat covers accounting. Aon, Zurich, and hartford have insurance and Human Resources. Guaranteed full time work and an associates degree in the case of aon. Salary of 35k isn’t great, but better than going out of pocket and much better adjusting for risk or compared to grocery store job held while in college. This in USA 

Wells Fargo for collections and management. Cvs has pharmacy tech.

Loc 2332 on the importance of staffing firms in driving this. Loc 2350 a bad hire can cost a firm 240k!! Whoa! How they get that?

2485 - did Avenica go live w new project in 2018 across industries?

2545, ch 8 - "Prominent researchers have questioned the return on investment for online courses." citation(s) may provide sources for the "opposition to my view..." but wait what is my view? my view is still in formation...i guess my view is "alternative paths are sometimes preferred to the traditional path" but this doesn't seem to be a thing anyone opposes...it's more like some people might contest a specific prescription, not that general point. But, if someone generally detracts from online, vocational, or otherwise alternative, or if someone supports the traditional route to an extreme (eg 90-100% of high school students should do it), then that could be considered an opponent of my present working view.

loc 2575: not only are universities adopting innovative or alternative strategies, non-traditional providers are adopting traditional strategies in some cases. Prototypical alternative online educator Udacity launched a series of physical campuses in 2016 under a program called Udacity Connect. Udacity Connect offers the same courses which are offered under MOOCs, but with a physical place for students and teachers to interact. Udacity points out that students using Udacity Connect graduate 5x more frequently than those using the online-only version of the class.

loc 2727 - simple knowledge sharing / communication / career discovery is a big bottleneck. Yellowbrick is a resource which awards certificates in Fashion, Beauty, and Sports so-called industry essentials, but these certificate courses largely consist of career discovery instruction, and career preparedness including the development of an e-portfolio along recommended lines.

loc 2820 - portfolios for non-developers! including microcredidentials; so, ostensibly at a minimum anyone who has micro creds can have a portfolio, and this does cut across major industries, eg it does substitute for common degrees

loc 3023 - "go to college indicators." How does craig stack against caplan? Vs my opinion? I would be hard pressed to tell anyone not to go to college if it contributed to net higher lifetime earnings, but preference always matters...

loc 3363, ch 10. raises the objection to short-term, focused education on the fact that less short term options yield better long-term employment. In one rebut to this criticism, Craig harps on one of his favorite key phrases: "new color," which is not traditional blue color or vocational but is instead a software-integrated vocational role, requiring at least expert familiarity with a set of software and general digital skills, as well as often requiring or favoring those with some some creative digital expertise (code, UX, agile process mgmt, business analysts, software creation or mgmt)

loc 3380 agrees w caplan that fadeout on learning is severe, but do Craig's sources on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve not actually present an even more calculation-friendly approach?? Caplan seems to argue based on a wider set of evidence at the expense of losing a potent, concise formulation in ebbinghaus. ultimately, these approaches go together but i prefer ebbinghaus for calculation and quick, though non-comprehensive, reference

loc 3442 - it's always discomforting when an author refers to a source you know to be questionable; the chocolate milk from brown cows research is such an essentially discredited story. Americans tend to think milk cows in general are brown: Jersey cows are brown for example. The researchers are not even fourthcoming with the exact question(s) and answer(s). the result is a discredit case of common-man bashing which, like many such cases, on further investigation, reveals the common man is often surprisingly well informed. Indeed, it may be the case that milk producing cows tend to be brown cows.

finally, ch 10 lements the 'loss of fun,' but I think that is a value overstated in the literature, and particularly by education scholars. I think Caplan rightly points out many people see college activities as net suffering, even compared to ordinary work.

loc 3800, the appendix, a directory of alternatives to college, including which jobs each program prepares a participant for, is a phenomenal resource. For the relevant consumer, the appendix alone makes purchase of the book more than worthwhile.
