# Papers README

Each subdirectory of this /papers directory is in connection with a single publishable paper.

My workflow is that I first publish to SSRN then I attempt to get it published in a journal.

If a paper has reached a stage where it is available on SSRN, it will have a /major-revisions subfolder.

If there are multiple versions within /major-revisions then there will be a README explaining what each version is for.
