This paper was initially rejected (prior to BHR) with helpful feedback.
This README indicates the fixes I made, a bit like a response to a referee.
The good news is that the rejection indicated the subject matter is interesting. No journal fit problem.

Problem - the identification assumptions necessary to interpret results as causal are questionable

Solution: I have censored any claims of causality. Instead, I now argue that 

Problem - subjective selection and de-selection of explanatory variables based on their importance in a kitchen sink regression

Solution: I have removed the kitchen sink analysis, selected variables for alternate reasons, and re-run the analysis.

Problem - the choice of one measure of the dependent variable based on its predictability rather than its economic or policy relevance

Solution: I have removed commentary about predictability and selected the dependent variable based on policy intent, with reference

Problem - the paper needs to have a clearer presentation of the research question

Solution: I have specified the research question articulately and early in the first page of the manuscript.

Problem - the paper needs to have a clearer presentation of the research methodology

Solution: I have added a section on research methodology and given detailed information.

Problem - the paper needs to have a clearer presentation of the results.

Solution: I have reorganized the existing section on results and had four academic peers review the entire paper for readability.

Problem - the paper needs to have a clearer presentation of implications.

Solution: I have re-written the conclusion section to deal more clearly with implications of the analysis.

other new info:
1. https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2013/02/28/section-127-tuition-aid/#4b071f9b71ff
  - we should remove age 21 minimum (harms benefit to undergrads)
  - we should drop employer requirement (folks that own their own businesses are at an advantage)
  - "Section 127 is usually applied to graduate level or night school study" - was that intended?

2.
  - new variable: permanently extends employer-provided education assistance

3. https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/cares-act-offers-opportunity-for-tax-76795/
  - CARES act allows employers to pay down old debt in addition to deducting new expenses (it's temporary)




"Reduce administrative inequities arising from uncertainties" - arguably achieved in 2013 with non-temporary legislation,
but re-introduced in 2020 with CARES act temporary employer ability to pay down (CARES act passed with other policy goals in mind...outside of scope of study but available for analysis)
"Reduce the complexity of the tax code" - fail. Section 127 is much more complex compared to a clear alternative (no employer restriction)
"Remove disincentives to upward mobility [particularly among lower-paid and less-skilled workers" - fail. most directly assessed by this study, higher education is meant to enable upward mobility and enrollment would be the mechanism - but due to access reasons it doesn't work.
the thing is mainly used for already-graduated folks to achieve a graduate degree (small relative upward progress and wrong targeting)
