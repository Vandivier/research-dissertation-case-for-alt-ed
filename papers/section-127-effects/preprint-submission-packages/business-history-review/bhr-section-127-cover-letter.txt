Dear Dr. Friedman, Dr. Jones, and BHR Editorial Team,

I'm pleased to submit "The Impact of Employer Education Assistance on Enrollment" for your consideration.

This paper contributes to the policy literature on employer tuition assistance.

Related papers in this literature include "Employee development, commitment, and intention to turnover" Benson 2006 and "Educational policy and the law" Yudof et al. 2011.

This paper is an empirical macroanalysis of Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Section 127 provides for tax-deductible employer educational assistance in the United States.

I compare outcomes from 1973 through 2016 and ask whether the policy achieves its own goals.

I conclude that there are systematic problems with the policy.

For example, legislators intended Section 127 to benefit low-skill individuals, but the deduction increasingly funds graduate education.

The paper uses an original data set with several specifications.

I find that Section 127 has a positive linear effect on enrollment as intended, but that the policy effect is statistically insignificant.

I interpret insignificance mainly as an access issue and suggest policy changes to improve success.

I also provide evidence on the H-1B immigration policy as a potential tool to stimulate college enrollment.

I confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal.

I, the sole author, have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to the Business History Review.

Best,
John Vandivier
