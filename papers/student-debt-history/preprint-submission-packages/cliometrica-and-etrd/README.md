This package was originally submitted to Cliometrica as CLIO-D-20-00004
and rejected for lack of journal fit.

This package was then more recently internally transfered and submitted as ETRD-D-20-00095
to Educational Technology Research & Development (ETRD)
also for lack of journal fit.

The only diff between the blinded and non-blinded text is the use of the following obfuscated data URL:
`See \url{https://osf.io/sbt7m/?view_only=808ef02d99024d9ab86b84db359abf06}`

The tex diff involves a few more lines. Non-obfuscated versions are below and deleted from the blinded version:
