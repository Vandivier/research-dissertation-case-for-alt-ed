Dear Dr. Friedman, Dr. Jones, and BHR Editorial Team,

I'm pleased to submit "New Digital Education as the Market Solution to the Student Debt Crisis" for your consideration.

This paper gives critical context to academic and policy discussions on education, accredited learning, and remote learning.

This paper argues that technology in the modern era of online learning results in an important difference in the modern learning experience and outcomes.
As a result, academic work and policies generated even a decade ago must be reconsidered.

The paper is a macro analysis that uses two large and open data sets, including Google Trends data.

I confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal.

I, the sole author, have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to the Business History Review.

Best,
John Vandivier
