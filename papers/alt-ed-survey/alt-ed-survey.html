        Traditional postsecondary learning in the United States is associated
        with increased earnings and employment, but these benefits come at
        substantial cost. Nontraditional education provides a partial workaround
        with a variety of caveats including nonconformity stigma. This paper
        explores a novel data set (n = 1190) to understand trends in public
        disposition on alternative credentials. Results indicate that
        favorability is high, declining in the short term, and may reverse trend
        over time. Leveraging alternative pathways to reduce cost and accelerate
        completion of accredited education is a recommended strategy. Some
        policy considerations are discussed.

    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The concept of a student debt crisis has found durable academic and media
      coverage. In 1999, Roots called the student loan debt crisis a lesson in
      unintended consequences. He identified the issue as attributable in large
      part to the Guaranteed Student Loan Program of 1965.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was neither a new lesson at that time, nor a lesson finally learned at
      that time. Hansendn and Rhodes discuss the student debt crisis in 1988.
      Van Dusen published a genuinely prescient paper, The Coming Crisis in
      Student Aid, in February 1979. Forbes noted in 2019 that “Student loan
      debt in 2019 is the highest ever…There are more than 44 million borrowers
      who collectively owe \$1.5 trillion in student loan debt in the U.S.
      alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Recent work has called into question both the social return and the
      individual return to spending on education. Alternatives to the status quo
      in education present the opportunity for significant economic benefit.
      From 1989 to 2012, the average cost of a year of undergraduate education
      in the US rose 79%. Over the same period, per pupil public expenditure for
      K-12 students increased 27%. This indicates that postsecondary education
      presents a particularly valuable area of exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1989 to 2012, K-12 student expenditure increased significantly and
      the cost of a year of undergraduate education grew nearly three times more
      quickly, but the adjusted average starting salary of a college graduate
      decreased. In real terms, the average starting salary of a college
      graduate decreased about 9%. Additional temporal sampling from 1960 to
      2015 indicates that the longer trend for education is modestly positive,
      with a real increase of about 6% over that period. It’s worth noting that
      the highest paying years for the degree were observed around 1970 in real
      terms, and salaries after the Great Recession have remained lower than the
      early 2000s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the price of college is rising several times faster than the rate
      at which the salary of new graduates is increasing, the traditional degree
      is becoming a dynamically worse financial investment, and current research
      shows it is already a relatively poor choice compared to investing in a
      standard fund from the social point of view, although it is clearly
      lucrative from the individual perspective. Caplan estimates the private
      average annual return to attempting a year of college is about 4.9% in
      Chapter 5 of The Case Against Education. In Chapter 6 he calculates the
      social return to college at less than 2%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annualized 20 year returns on an S&amp;P index, in contrast, typically
      return between 4 and 9%. It’s worth noting that Caplan uses 2011-2012
      in-state tuition and fees at public four-year universities when
      calculating return. From the 2011-2012 school year to the 2018-2019 school
      year, the relevant cost figure increased from 8,244 in 2011 dollars to
      10,230 in 2018 dollars. This represents a real cost increase of about 11%
      from 9,203 to 10,230 in 2018 dollars, after accounting for a cumulative
      rate of inflation of about 11.6% from 2011 to 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s also worth noting that this return on investment assumes no
      expenditure for residence. Ostensibly the student will be living at home.
      In practice, this greatly reduces the number of actual universities
      available for a learner to choose from, and this may force a student to
      choose a more expensive school. Many schools have an on-campus residency
      requirement, and many other schools will be too far to commute for most
      learners. Learning exclusively online from a provider which has no
      on-campus residency requirement remains an option, but this can safely be
      considered a non-traditional practice. In 2015, less than 15% of students
      were exclusively distance learners, although the number is trending up
      over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mattern and Wyatt note that college students live an average distance of
      268 miles from home and a median of 94 miles. This indicates that most
      students don’t live at home, and as a result housing costs should be
      included in both the average and median analysis of college price. Baum
      and Ma give the $8,244 tuition and fees figure used by Caplan, and they
      also provide a room and board figure of $8,887 for the 2011-2012 academic
      year. Abodo reports that median rent in 2018 for a 1/1 was about $1,010
      per month, and this works out to about $803 in 2011 dollars. At 9 months
      per year, it would have been a more affordable \$7,227 for the typical
      student to live in a 1/1 apartment than to consume university room and
      board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider that the modal degree is a Business degree, and the average
      salary for a business degree graduate is about $54,000. A common,
      in-demand occupation for someone holding a business degree is a business
      analyst role. Business analysts earn about $67,000 per year, and there
      many reputable bootcamp-style alternative learning programs for this
      occupation. Many of these bootcamps are online and take less than 6 months
      to complete and cost less than half of the \$7,227 price of housing alone.
      Online learning is not equally suited to all individuals. Minnesota State
      has a short quiz which helps individuals identify if online learning is a
      good fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      While traditional education is a decent investment, once we ignore typical
      housing costs, alternative education is a strictly better investment. This
      is because an individual can utilize alternative education to obtain a
      traditional credential for a lower price at an accelerated rate, and
      employers pay based on credentialing. The meaning of alternative education
      for the purposes of this paper is detailed in section 2, but one example
      of an alternative pathway to a traditional degree would be to leverage
      credit by examination. Almost any degree program can be partially
      fulfilled through credit by examination. In section 2.4 the price of
      credit by examination is calculated as about 15% of the traditional way to
      obtain credit in the average case.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to generalized cost reductions from alternative pathways,
      alternative credentialing programs sometimes allow learners to obtain
      better salary or employment for even less than 15% of the price of a
      traditional degree, and often over a much shorter time. In other cases,
      alternative education may be more expensive but desirable even so. General
      Assembly is an example of an Information Technology industry bootcamp.
      They teach business, marketing, and design courses in addition to the
      typical programming courses offered at similar programs. General Assembly
      costs $14,950 for its priciest full-time, immersive course, but students
      can finance in creative ways like $0 upfront with an income sharing
      agreement, where a student doesn’t need to pay until employed full-time.
      The immersive lasts about 3 months. 88% of GA students found full-time
      work within 90 days of graduation, and 99% found full-time work within 180
      days. This is in notable contrast to the traditional degree, where 54% of
      the class of 2015 had found a standard, full-time job 6 months after
      graduation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bootcamps can sometimes be used as a college substitute, but they can also
      be used after college graduation to differentiate a job candidate from
      competitors, or to switch careers or brush up on recent changes
      mid-career. Finally, many traditional universities now offer through prior
      learning assessments or credit by portfolio, so that bootcamps can result
      in college credit even without officially partnering with a university.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditional education might still be an optimal consumption choice if
      students demand higher education as leisure, but survey data indicates
      that this is not the case. Among a mix of prospective and first year
      college students from ages 16-40, Rachel Fishman finds that the top three
      reasons to go to college are improved employment, making more money, and
      getting a good job. Over 90% of respondents affirmed at least one of these
      reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      In A New U, Craig documents several faster and cheaper alternatives to
      college. Craig establishes that many of these alternative education
      solutions are quickly growing in both supply and demand, but it is not
      obvious whether the programs Craig discusses are representative of the
      broader ecosystem of alternative learning. Prior to Craig’s writing, Bryan
      Caplan argues for the signaling model of postsecondary credential value.
      On Caplan’s view, the consumer of alternative credentials faces a signal
      composition problem which threatens the value of the credential.
      Traditional credentials may do a better job of signaling things like work
      ethic and conformity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternative education, however, may endow real skills at a better rate
      than traditional education. Caplan estimates, for example, that the value
      of vocational education benefits is 40% signaling, in contrast with 80%
      signaling for the usual college education. If employers can obtain
      better-skilled workers for lower cost, they would be expected to have some
      willingness to give on conformity. In addition, as alternative credentials
      become more widely accepted, any stigma or nonconformity costs from
      pursuing alternative education is expected to diminish. Additionally,
      prior research has yet to establish magnitudes and dynamic trends on those
      magnitudes for many of these important effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      This paper explores a novel attitudinal data set on alternative
      credentials. This paper tests the thesis that employers will favor
      alternative credentials as a mechanism to identify suitable entry level
      employment. As a secondary interest, changes over time to the relation of
      interest are investigated. The structure of included survey data allows
      for exploration of several other interesting tertiary relations.

      The first section describes the organization of the paper, the motivation,
      and the main thesis. The second section gives theoretical and historical

    <h2 id="section-2-1-introduction-to-the-theory-of-alternative-education">
      Section 2.1 - Introduction to the Theory of Alternative Education
    </h2>
    <p>
      This second section is broken into six subsections. The first subsection
      gives an overview of the subsequent five sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because alternative education is characterized as the negation of
      traditional education, the second subsection begins by conceptualizing
      tradition. Section 2.3 moves from theoretical conceptualization of
      tradition into a brief inventory of actual American history, including
      legislation relevant to the topic of interest. The description of
      traditional credentials toward the end of the third section flows
      naturally into a discussion on alternative credentials in the fourth
      section. The three subtypes of alternative education are detailed
      throughout the fourth section. The subtypes include alternative
      credentials, alternative pathways, and alternative pedagogies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2.5 synthesizes these subtypes into a discussion of alternative
      education and alternativeness in a general way. The fifth subsection also
      discusses minor results from outside of the main data set which help
      concretize the concept of alternativeness intended throughout the paper.
      To further clarify the intuition of the thesis, Subsection 2.6 describes a
      game-theoretic model of dynamic norms.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-2-2-traditions-conceptualized">
      Section 2.2 - Traditions Conceptualized
    </h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the paper, the variable of interest will be referred to in a
      few ways. The variable of interest is most concisely described as
      entry-level suitability. More completely, the variable of interest is
      favorability on the use of alternative credentials to qualify an
      entry-level candidate who is applying for a career position. Technically,
      and most completely, the variable of interest is a response between 1 and
      10 to the question, “For many professions, alternative credentials can
      qualify a person for an entry-level position.” A response of 10 represents
      a strong agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternative credentials fit into the broader research area on alternative
      education. Alternative education is defined as all education other than
      traditional education. Alternative education decomposes into three
      subtopics including alternative credentials, alternative pathways, and
      alternative pedagogy. Each of these alternative entities is defined by the
      negation of their traditional counterpart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In service of an effective description of alternative credentials,
      traditions are described in this subsection. Traditions can be concisely
      described as intertemporal social norms. As such, traditions exist in
      socio-temporal space. The maximum socio-temporal space that such a
      tradition could occupy would be from the dawn of humankind until today,
      and among all humans. Tradition can be viewed on a spectrum, where some
      processes are relatively traditional, and the modal process among a group
      of comparable processes is the strictly defined traditional process,
      implied when the singular traditional process is referred to.

      Section 2.3 - Actual Traditions: A History of Accreditation and Student
      Lending in the United States
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the vantage point just established, postsecondary accreditation is a
      peculiar and infant approach to learning and education. Private
      accrediting agencies began forming in the 1880s in the United States, and
      private accreditation had become a well-established element of the higher
      education landscape by the 1930s. The G.I. Bill was signed into law in
      1944, and provisions of the bill boosted consumption of higher education
      through subsidy to military service members. The number of degrees awarded
      by US colleges and universities more than doubled between 1940 and 1950.
      The increased demand for education stimulated the formation of many new
      colleges, and some of these were perceived to be “of dubious quality.” The
      G.I. Bill was reauthorized in 1952, but this time the educational benefits
      it included were restricted in availability to those students enrolling at
      an accredited institution, and the U.S. Commissioner of Education began
      publishing a list of federally recognized accredited institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, federal recognition criteria became more elaborate. The 1992
      Amendments to the Higher Education Act is a notable act in this regard.
      Federal lending began in a military-oriented fashion with the National
      Defense Education Act of 1958, but lending was expanded to the general
      population with the 1965 Higher Education Act and subsequent legislation.
      As earlier noted, Roots and other scholars identify this legislative trend
      as essentially causal to our present student debt crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brief history indicates that federal postsecondary accreditation is
      not only new as a human institution, but also new within the much more
      limited context of United States history. It’s true that market-driven
      accreditation has existed since the 1880s, and therefore may be considered
      a traditional process in United States education, but it is not true that
      the federal accreditation process which exists today has been around
      through most of American history. In this sense, federal accreditation is
      both causal in our present debt crisis and decidedly nontraditional.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point of this exercise is both to familiarize the reader with a bit of
      relevant history, and to initiate conceptualization of traditional
      education as a special case of alternative education, rather than
      something altogether different. The traditional education of today was
      itself an alternative form of education at some point in time, and it
      remains a minority approach to education within a variety of nontrivial
      timeframes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caplan rightly argues that part of the signal of a traditional degree is
      to signal conformity, but throughout most of history it would be the
      nonconformist who possesses the thing we now call a traditional degree.
      Given this prior information, it becomes more plausible that society might
      one day return to such a situation. Obtaining a federally accredited
      undergraduate degree is a rather new practice, although we call it a
      tradition, and it has always been dubiously socially beneficial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditional education is loosely synonymous with accredited education in
      the United States, but there are important technical differences.
      Accredited credentials in the context of the US include the high school
      diploma, the accredited undergraduate degree, and accredited graduate
      education. While graduate education is accredited, it is also excluded
      from the concept of traditional education. While tradition indicates a
      normal activity, graduate education is unusual. About 9% of U.S. adults
      had a graduate degree in 2000, and about 13% had such a degree as of 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, it’s not technically traditional to get a college degree.
      Technically speaking, the American tradition is to enroll in college
      degree and never graduate. The history of factors leading to higher
      enrollment in higher education in the United States, was previously
      discussed, but it’s an important historical watermark to notice that 51%
      of Americans immediately enrolled in college after high school completion
      beginning in 1975. Between 1975 and 2011, the immediate college enrollment
      rate increased from 51 percent to 68 percent. Immediate transition to
      college plateaued after the turn of the century. The immediate college
      enrollment rates for 4-year and for 2-year colleges in 2016 were not
      measurably different from 2000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enrolling in college has been a tradition since 1975, but obtaining a
      degree never was a tradition in the same way. The fact that the trend on
      immediate enrollment has slowed from a positive trend into a plateau,
      which has now remained stably flat for more than a decade, casts doubt on
      the plausibility of a move back to a positive trend. For the foreseeable
      future, the expected trend on immediate enrollment is between flat and the
      possibility of a small decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2016, the percentage of students enrolling in college in the fall
      immediately following high school completion was 69.8%, but in 2016 the
      percentage of the adult population with a bachelor’s degree or higher was
      33.4% for “the first time in decades of data.” To reiterate the point, the
      strictly modal pattern of educational attainment would be for an American
      student to obtain a diploma, enroll in an accredited undergraduate degree
      program, and never obtain an undergraduate degree.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-2-4-three-subtypes-of-alternative-education">
      Section 2.4 - Three Subtypes of Alternative Education
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the final paragraph of the above section describes the strictly
      modal pattern of educational attainment in the modern United States, the
      pattern of enrollment plus noncompletion does not describe the state of
      being desired by those who enroll. The desired situation would be college
      graduation. As all ideas are antecedent to action, the desire to complete
      college is identified as more traditional than the actualization of
      college completion. The nuanced difference between a desire and its
      actualization is lost when speaking loosely, and as a result the actual
      four-year degree is loosely identified as a traditional credential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternative education is a general term which includes alternative
      credentials, alternative pathways, and alternative pedagogies. Each of
      these alternative entities is characterized by the negation of a
      traditional counterpart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditional pedagogy is the lecture format. K-12 education and higher
      education have both typically utilized this teaching method during and
      outside of the post-1975 period of interest, despite wide knowledge on the
      ineffectiveness of this approach. In 2014, for example, a meta-analysis of
      225 studies found that undergraduate students in classes with traditional
      lectures are 1.5 times more likely to fail than students in classes that
      use active learning methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pathway is a series of actions culminating in the attainment of
      education or a credential. The traditional pathway always culminates in
      the traditional credential, but alternative pathways may also culminate in
      the traditional credential. For example, a student may obtain significant
      college credit or even complete an entire degree program through credit by
      examination. This competency-based pathway is importantly different
      compared to the traditional pathway based on the credit hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it’s common for students to self-study in preparation for credit by
      examination, it’s also common for students to attend preparatory classes
      or even obtain knowledge for the purposes of testing out of one course by
      sitting in another traditional course. That situation could occur if a
      student took a course at one university, changed universities, and the
      credit would not transfer for the original course. Although their credit
      did not automatically transfer, the student might be able to test out at
      the second school. In cases like these, the student may have obtained a
      traditional credential through education using a traditional lecture-based
      pedagogy, and yet the pathway was not traditional.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distinction of pathways might seem like splitting hairs in theory, but
      in practice alternative pathways like credit by examination, prior
      learning assessment, credit by portfolio, and similar processes hold
      immense potential as a time and cost savings mechanism for the student,
      while holding constant any concerns over lack of an accredited degree. To
      briefly illustrate, the price of a CLEP test is $89 in 2019 dollars, while
      the average cost per credit hour at an accredited college is $594 in 2018
      dollars. A CLEP test may substitute for a 4-credit course. This means
      credit by examination is approximately 15% of the price of credit by
      credit hour.

      Section 2.5 - Alternative Education Broadly Conceptualized
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alternative education broadly encompasses all forms of formal and informal
      learning, but such a process space exceeds feasible study in a single
      paper, and frankly eludes sufficient study after combining many papers
      across several fields. Instead of studying alternative education
      holistically, researchers typically identify and studying a special case
      or particular implementation of alternative education.
    </p>
    <p>
      One benefit of this approach is that the researcher may identify specific
      instances of alternative education which are faster, cheaper, or otherwise
      preferred in some way relative to traditional education, but a weakness of
      such an approach is that findings appear small, rare, disbursed, and ad
      hoc. To collect such effects into a strong case against the existing norm,
      a systematic approach is required which establishes alternativeness as an
      independent factor which can then be tested for effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternativeness can be conceptualized ordinally or cardinally. Remember
      that the three subtypes of alternative education are alternative
      credentials, alternative pathways, and alternative pedagogies. Within each
      of these three subtypes, solutions within a given subtype can be
      identified and ranked according to popularity. After ranking from most
      popular to n-popularity, an increase in rank number synonymously
      represents decreasing traditional status and increasing alternativeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      By directly utilizing the underlying measure of popularity, a cardinal
      operationalization is achieved. Examples of popularity measures include
      number of applications, number of enrollments, expenditure toward a
      program, or survey-based measures of familiarity and favorability with
      respect to a specific program.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a brief concretization, a secondary data set is investigated. The
      College Board, which administers the SAT, recognizes four types of high
      school in 2014 and other years. These types include public, religiously
      affiliated, independent, and a group combining other and unknown types of
      schools. Table 1 shows reported measures of SAT performance by type of
      high school, augmented with third party data for homeschoolers. Table 2
      shows basic model results for cardinal and ordinal operationalizations,
      with linear and marginal effects in their expected directions. Low
      significance is attributable to small sample size. Notice the non-trivial
      R-square values identified despite the small sample size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other research indicates that charter schools perform modestly better than
      public schools when standardizing by SAT score, although nationally
      representative charter school data could not be found, and gains vary
      importantly by state and other factors.

      Section 2.6 - A Game-Theoretic Model of Dynamic Norms
    </h2>
    <p>
      It’s expected and intuitive that rank alternativeness would have a
      positive linear and negative marginal effect. Traditions are a kind of
      durable norm or institution. It’s a foundational lesson of New
      Institutional Economics that norms, institutions, and other classes of
      informal rules are self-sustaining and socially valued. If alternativeness
      continued to move in a positive direction ad infinitum, this would seem to
      indicate that traditions are perfectly opposed to maximal social value.
      That would be a jarring result which would fly in the face of much of
      mainline economics. Instead, the observed positive linear and negative
      marginal effects collectively indicate something much more compatible with
      orthodox economics. The indication is that some of tradition’s near
      neighbors represent an improvement, but continuing into the deeply
      alternative eventually detracts from value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Education fits a non-special case of norms models. As a completely
      standard example, Conley and Neilson use a prisoner’s dilemma to
      demonstrate equilibrium adoption of social norms. Suppose we modify this
      approach to account for dynamic technical improvement. In the present
      approach, consider an infinitely repeated prisoner’s dilemma where each
      round adds an additional option to choose cooperateN. CooperateN pays off
      (1 + cooperateN-1), and in the first round the participants are known to
      choose cooperate, because they have already equilibrated on the cooperate
      choice as a social norm. For the sake of modelling, also suppose there is
      a defectN added in each round as well, and it pays off (defectN-1 – 1),
      although it’s immediately obvious that coordination on such defects never
      obtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternative credentials include both technological improvements, and
      ostensibly technological degradation, relative to present-day norms, but
      according to the above game-theoretic representation, it’s not expected
      for society to equilibrate on any of the technologically degraded choices.
      Instead, it’s observed in the model that society will tend to adopt those
      preferred alternatives as they become available over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a more complex model, suppose that instead of both players gaining
      certain knowledge of the new cooperate option, each player had some
      probability of knowledge of the new cooperate option and some level of
      risk aversion. It’s now seen that there is some delay in adoption of the
      new cooperate choice, and in some rounds one or both players may prefer to
      remain on the prior cooperate space, but eventually all players tend
      toward the highest value cooperate choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a third model of highest complexity, suppose that two new cooperate
      choices are added each round instead of a single choice each round, but
      players only probabilistically know about the new choices. Figure 1
      presents a diagram of this game. The first new cooperate choice is
      revealed to both players with 99% probability, and the second cooperate
      choice has a payoff which is larger by one unit, but it is revealed to
      each player with a probability of 10%. Given standard models of nonlinear
      risk aversion, players will coordinate on the choice which is revealed
      with near certainty.
    </p>
    <p>

      Discovery

    <p>
      Other research echoes this story of dynamic curvilinear adoption of new
      technology under risk and uncertainty, with or without the game-theoretic
      explanation in similar or other forms. Marra et al covers this literature
      well in a paper on adoption of agricultural innovation. Marra emphasizes
      that agriculture is just one instance of a general learning concern, and
      the present paper considers itself similarly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This model clarifies risk aversion as a powerful mechanism for the
      incremental transition of norms from tradition toward alternatives. I
      propose that additional unmodeled mechanisms exist in the real world, but
      that the real-world trend nevertheless moves in the modeled direction. One
      example of an unmodeled consideration is that when an individual consumes
      alternative education in the real world, the payoff might be smaller than
      the traditional payoff.

      Section 2.7 - Actual Alternatives: A History of Alternative Education in
      the United States
    </h2>
    <p>
      Several other papers do a great job of assessing the history of
      alternative education prior to 2000. One important point in much of this
      literature is that differing concepts of alternative education are used.
      Aron states that the term alternative education, “in its broadest sense
      covers all educational activities that fall outside the traditional K-12
      school system (including home schooling, GED preparation K-12 school
      system (including home schooling, GED preparation programs, special
      programs for gifted children, charter schools, etc.), although the term is
      often used to describe programs serving vulnerable youth who are no longer
      in traditional schools.” In the same literature, Lange and Sletten are not
      abnormal in nearly using the term as a synonym for K-12 special education.
      They collect earlier research on the subject beginning in the 1960s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present paper takes an even broader look at alternative education by
      considering alternative post-secondary education including professional
      certifications and a crop of new, non-accredited, digital credentials like
      the Udacity Nanodegree. By looking at post-secondary education, the
      present paper unifies the literature on K-12 alternative education with
      the literature on nontraditional students. One might think nontraditional
      students exist in the K-12 space, and they do, but the nontraditional
      student literature focuses on college students in particular. Dill and
      Henly, operationalize a nontraditional student as “as having multiple
      roles (e.g., parent, employee, student) and at least 1 year between high
      school and college.” Taniguchi and Kaufman define a nontradional student
      as, “those who enter four-year colleges or universities as adults, or at
      age 21 or older.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A variety of definitions are used for alternative education and
      nontraditional learning, but many of the solutions are robust across these
      definitions. The present paper emphasizes postsecondary alternative
      learning, but many of the technical solutions which are helpful in this
      space are also helpful elsewhere. Partially or fully online learning,
      personalized learning, and active learning are examples of alternative
      pedagogies which improve results across many of these categories.

      Harasim gives a good history of online education from the founding of the
      world wide web in 1992 through the year 2000. Allen and Seaman gave an
      early look at online education beginning in 2003 and proceeding annually,
      then they released an informative 10-year review in 2013. From these
      papers we can already see some clear problems and advantages with online
      learning. Advantages include lower cost and improved learning outcomes
      from web-assisted or hybrid courses. The effectiveness of online learning
      grew importantly over the early 2000s. In 2003, 57.2 percent of academic
      leaders rated learning outcomes from online education as the same or
      better than face-to-face, while the number rose to 77% in 2012.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs, are a major topic in the modern
      digital learning literature. In the Allen and Seaman note that, “Academic
      leaders remain unconvinced that MOOCs represent a sustainable method for
      offering online courses, but do believe they provide an important means
      for institutions to learn about online pedagogy.” The literature on MOOCs
      is broadly pessimistic about effectiveness. A well-designed study in 2015
      found that a majority of MOOCs scored highly on organization of material
      and low on instructional design.

      Universities are shifting to become more like their alternative
      competitors, but an interesting finding is that their competitors are also
      shifting to become more university-like, so that traditional educators and
      disruptive educators both appear to be equilibrating around a hybrid
      model, and even partnering directly with each other so that online
      education providers are beginning to offer college credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present paper is focused on suitability of alternative credential. A
      prototypical example of the type of modern, digital, alternative
      credential the research is intended to relate to would be the Udacity
      Nanodegree. This credential is specifically mentioned during survey
      administration. The survey includes a brief statement on alternative
      credentials as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternative credentials include certificates, documents, and other proof
      of receiving education, other than traditional credentials. Traditional
      credentials include a high school diploma or an undergraduate degree from
      an accredited university. An example of an alternative credential is a
      Nanodegree from Udacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there is some ongoing discussion in the current literature to the
      effect that online education is still contentious, the present section
      shows that online and hybrid learning are in fact a new normal which has
      been developing for some time. The disruptive education of Clayton
      Christiansen and Michael Horn has already been incorporated into the
      typical university.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the present paper strongly argues for alternative education, it
      agrees with scholars like Jeffrey Selingo. Jeff agrees that the bundled
      service model of the traditional 4-year undergraduate degree is
      collapsing, but rather than foreseeing a market takeover by nimbler
      competitors, Jeff is optimistic that universities will be able to adapt.
      This theme of universities successfully adapting to become like their
      competitors, rather than being ousted by competitors, is a major theme of
      the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Robinson and Selingo we see traditional providers including four-year
      universities adapting and innovating by adopting best-of-breed
      technologies, pedagogies, and program structures piloted by alternative
      providers. Craig shows that this flow is bidirectional, rather than
      unidirectional. Craig notes that Udacity&#39;s latest innovation is the
      in-person course. Besomebody Paths are fully offline. The typical course
      seems to be achieving equilibrium among a range of subtly different, but
      substantively similar, hybrid modes. Far from being an artifact of
      overfitting this literature, the elucidated pattern is consistent with
      multiple stories that none of these authors mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      An elementary conversation on alternative education consists in
      contrasting disruptive private education and online learning providers
      with traditional education. Clayton Christiansen lead development of
      thought on disruptive innovation and worked with Michael Horn to bring
      this analysis to the field of education in 2008 with a book entitled
      Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World
      Learns. Notice the change in tense between 2008 and 2011, when Clayton
      publishes a second book on the subject called The Innovative University:
      Changing the DNA of Higher Education from the Inside Out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A correct understanding of those in the movement of the disruption of
      education is not that they are anticipating declining university
      enrollment any time soon. Southern New Hampshire University and Western
      Governors University‎ are mentioned as leaders in competency-based
      education. In one part of Selingo’s College (Un)Bound, he mentions Paul
      LeBlanc. Paul LeBlanc identifies himself as a disrupter in the vein of
      Christiansen. He considers the online learning revolution old news and
      competency-based education is the more recent innovation. LeBlanc believes
      that competency-based education will come from existing institutions, and
      will exist alongside four-year programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2011, the same year that Christiansen noticed the present-tense
      changing of higher education’s DNA, Sebastian Thrun manifested the
      Christiansen of 2008 and ignored the Christiansen of 2011 by relinquishing
      his tenure at Stanford to found Udacity. Udacity&#39;s first courses began
      taking students in early 2012. Only in 2013 did Udacity begin contributing
      to changing the university by offering some courses for college credit. In
      2014, Udacity entered into its first full-fledged partnership with a
      university. The same year, Udacity released its first signature
      alternative credential, the Nanodegree. Excitement filled the air. About
      that time, as Craig informs us, the evidence on weak outcomes for
      Udacity&#39;s courses and other MOOCs began to cause significant doubt. In
      2017, Udacity Connect was launched. This product is a hybrid learning
      solution which occurs partly in a classroom setting and partly online. Now
      that the results have started coming in, as earlier mentioned, this
      approach has shown about a 500% increase in graduation rate.

      In 2016, Khan Academy applied for the \$100 million dollar grant by
      100&amp;Change in order to create a globally recognized secondary
      education diploma. 1904 organizations applied for the grant. 1870
      proposals are documented in a solution explorer made public by
      100&amp;Change. 375 proposals are in the education category. When
      decisions were rendered in 2017, Khan Academy&#39;s proposal earned an
      honorable mention as one of the top ten in the education category, but it
      did not place among the 8 semi-finalists across categories and did not
      earn a financial award.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Udacity, Khan Academy is an online learning provider which went
      through a period of immense excitement followed by failure, and also like
      Udacity, Khan Academy achieved a remarkable success on a different project
      during the same calander year as their disenchanting loss. In 2017, Khan
      Academy released the results of a study they conducted with the College
      Board. It showed that studying for the SAT using Khan Academy is
      associated with 115-point average score increase. Khan Academy also became
      the official practice partner for AP exams in 2017.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only do Udacity and Khan Academy share a Jungian hero typology, they
      have both evolved from traditional learning competitors to traditional
      learning allies. Like Coursera, edX, and others, the best-of-breed
      alternative learning providers of today are not substituting for
      traditional education providers, they are integrating with them. Likewise,
      the best-of-breed traditional providers are not rejecting new learning
      approaches, they are partnering with them, awarding credit to students for
      alternative learning, and even supplying online education providers with
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      While literature can be found further back that applies in ways
      increasingly less direct, I consider Christiansen&#39;s 2008 piece to be a
      watermark in the literature. With Udacity&#39;s course offerings in early
      2012, I observe a bright line in the actualization of modern alternative
      education provision. With Udacity, Coursera, Khan Academy, and other major
      online learning providers having been through significant revision in just
      a few years, I consider 2018 to be a new age of alternative education.
      Significant changes occured during 2017, so 2018 will have been the first
      year in which these changes were available throughout the period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general trend is toward integration of traditional and alternative
      providers, but alternative learning systems are heterogenous and these
      heterogenous solutions are not equal in optimality for consumption by any
      particular individual, nor at the social level. Portfolios, and digital
      portfolios in particular, are in demand by employers. Digital portfolios
      have recently become trendy among universities, while they have been in
      fashion with alternative providers for some time. Standardized portfolio
      artifact generation and evaluation is becoming more standardized over
      time, assisted by certain dedicated evaluation providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apprenticeship programs are making a comeback as a matter of fact,
      although it is controversial to claim that this is an obvious social good.
      These programs never truly left Germany, but they have revived from
      slumber in the UK. Under Trump, the US saw a major step forward for a
      particular implementation of apprenticeship, but it has been a
      controversial policy implementation, as discussed in the atemporal
      findings section. Like apprenticeship, many scholars find themselves
      supporting evidence-based learning, even while criticizing particular
      implementations of learning assessment. It is particularly fashionable to
      criticize standardized examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standardized exams typically have certain question formats, including
      multiple choice or essay response questions which may be graded according
      to a rubric. Examples of standardized exams include the SAT, the ACT, the
      international PISA, and many state-level exams including the Texas STAAR.
      Standardized exams are generally cost-effective means of generating
      meaningful signals, but these signals are often systematically imperfect,
      and those imperfections are the source of much discussion. While
      portfolios may be costlier to generate and evaluate, they seem to be
      substantially less controversial in both the literature and when surveying
      professionals. Portfolios may include a broad range of expression, and the
      complexity of normalizing these expressions may be one reason for a
      silence in the academic literature. The best explanation for high
      professional opinion, on the other hand, may be plain efficacy of skill
      demonstration by the candidate to a knowledgeable portfolio reviewer.

      A history of alternative education was just given, evidencing an argument
      about the directional trend of education. Earlier a similar thing was done
      with traditional education. This section notes some important points on
      education which seem to hold in a non-trending way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intellectually, there is a clean distinction between a disruption camp and
      a non-disruption camp. In the real world, the leaders in either camp exist
      much more in the middle of the two than toward the extremes. The leading
      thinkers and practitioners in favor of the university system acknowledge
      that universities should continue to innovate, and adopting
      non-traditional features is practically, and in some sense tautologically,
      the means to that end. The leading thinkers and practitioners opposed to
      the legacy system acknowledge that the legacy system is firmly entrenched
      and will continue to be so for many years, and so the optimal course of
      action for individuals and for society is for new providers to integrate,
      cooperate, and coordinate with those legacy systems, instead of attempting
      to steal consumers in a winner-take-all fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is that leading thinkers and practitioners on both sides
      largely support both alternative education and traditional education.
      Moreover, leaders on both sides generally agree on which pedagogies,
      technologies, and so on, provide optimal results in most cases. A cursory
      glance at the non-book literature demonstrates the difficulty involved in
      locating a formal paper with citations in excess of the single digits
      which promotes the traditional lecture mode of class instruction. I could
      only find one from by Kalogeras in 1976. While the magazines occasionally
      headline an article which pretends to defend lecture, seldom make and
      evidence-based case and often essentially concede the point. Consider
      <em>In Defense of the Lecture</em>, a 2014 article from the Chronicle of
      Higher Education. This article points out specific virtues of lecture,
      even while conceding &quot;...lecturing as a means of transferring basic
      factual information is a poor way to teach. I agree...&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The differences in opinion seem rather limited, and they almost
      universally apply to macroeconomic issues. The closest thing to
      disagreement on microeconomic choices seems to be threefold:
    </p>
    <p>
      Some scholars are aware of interesting programs or technologies which
      other scholars are not aware of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scholars heterogeneously trust the payoff claims of particular programs of
      alternative learning.
    </p>
    <p>Some scholars oppose particular alternative education techniques.</p>
    <p>
      Expanding on the third point above, Eric Hanushek recently stated “We
      should not delude ourselves into thinking that Trump’s apprenticeship
      expansion will substitute for our failing K-12 schooling
      system...Vocationally-trained workers with relatively narrow skills face a
      harsher labor market with time as the nature of production changes.” Along
      the same lines, a Brooking study to which Hanushek contributed found that
      excess utilization of an apprenticeship model at the social level could
      generate a skill gap. Despite Hanushek&#39;s particular position on the
      Trump plan, and perhaps his general opposition to excess utilization of
      apprenticeship, it is clear that he does not oppose alternative education
      writ large, and that he does not deny the utility of vocational training
      for particular individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth mentioning that both of these main microeconomic concerns are
      being addressed over time by projects like Credential Engine, which seeks
      to comprehensively catalog non-accredited credentials and standardize
      their outcome measurement and reporting. An alternative strategy is
      provided by firms like Degreed, which markets a generalized service to
      measure any skill. This approach simplifies the measurement trust problem
      from a need to trust heterogenous providers to the need to trust a single
      provider of learning measurement, Degreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many less comprehensive skill measurement providers exist. Pluralsight,
      for example, is a relatively well known and reputed firm in the IT market.
      Pluralsight provides a standard measurement service for a specific range
      of skills. This measurement process obtains independent from where the
      learning or skill development occurred. In this sense, employers can
      choose to trust a skill measurement provider instead of directly trusting
      a learning provider. This simplifies the analysis problem for employers,
      and it also creates an additional incentive for learning providers to
      provide good content. If many students pass through an alternative
      learning process, then perform poorly during standard evaluation, the poor
      performance becomes attributable in part or whole to that alternative
      learning process.

      The main sources of debate seem to be on macroeconomic concerns. These
      concerns are completely out of my interest, but they are worth noting:
    </p>
    <p>What is the best course of action for the mean or median student?</p>
    <p>What should be done with public funds for education?</p>
    <p>
      Should the existing educational requirements for certain professional
      licenses be reevaluated, or should certain licenses be created or
      destroyed?
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to me that if there is to be any meaning to the labelling of a
      scholar as in favor of traditional education, it merely means that, with
      respect to the macroeconomic points mentioned above, the scholar believes
      at least one of, and possibly all of, the following:
    </p>
    <p>The mean or median student should obtain a four-year degree.</p>
    <p>
      The growth in public education spending should remain constant, or perhaps
      grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least some professions benefit from licensing, and at least some
      licenses benefit from requiring accredited education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caplan would represent, then, a non-traditional position. Hanushek would
      represent a moderate position between these extremes, arguing that
      policymakers should not grow spending, or perhaps cut it non-drastically,
      but mainly focus on spending in a more intelligent way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this macroeconomic categorization, even the proponent of traditional
      education need not say a particular student should necessarily obtain a
      four-year degree, although it would seem to be a null hypothesis. It is
      this null hypothesizing mechanism which finally allows us to obtain some
      meaningful distinction at the microeconomic level, whereas breaking
      scholars into camps according to their attitude on disruption seems like a
      red herring.

      Comparable survey questions obtained a maximum of 1190 responses during
      four administration windows including portions of February 2018, October
      2018, February 2019, and May 2019. Appendix 1 details the wording of
      questions and the answers available. Appendix 2 identifies which factors
      were included in each administration, notes significant factors by
      administration, and gives shorthand factor names. In general, significant
      factors and variables of interest were persisted across administration.
      Weak factors or tangential curiosities were included only in a subset of
      administrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The survey was created in SurveyMonkey and responses were gathered using
      SurveyMonkey Paid Audiences, Amazon Mechanical Turk, social media posts,
      and word of mouth. Responses were grouped according to their origin using
      a construct in SurveyMonkey which is called a collector. Collector effects
      were insignificant. This is interesting for two reasons. First, the source
      populations are known to be systematically different. Perhaps the most
      notable known systematic difference is that Amazon Mechanical Turk
      respondents were guaranteed to be U.S. High School graduates. A second
      reason the insignificance of collector effects is important is that
      response prices were significantly different. Amazon Mechanical Turk
      responses were more than 20% cheaper than SurveyMonkey Paid Audience
      responses on average.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systematic analysis of the novel data set includes 106 right-hand
      variables and two left-hand variables. Ad hoc analysis checked another 8
      selectively created interaction or similar variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Variable-level sample sizes range from 240 to 1190. Appendix 3 lists
      technical variable names in alphabetical order along with summary
      statistics. Appendix 4 lists variable names in alphabetical order, and
      summarizes factor strength across models. Factors are generally
      operationalized into multiple variables. Appendix 4 makes this
      factor-to-variable mapping clear by identifying the factor short name
      related to each variable. For example, 9 gender variables were explored.
      These variables are sometimes complimentary, and in other cases they are
      directly redundant with another representation of the same construct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data exploration began and by investigating arbitrary relations of
      interest. These ad hoc findings of interest are discussed in section 3.5.
      The primary variable of interest goes by the variable name voi and is
      referred to in shorthand as entry-level suitability. It is structured as a
      favorability question on a scale from 1 to 10. See the description of
      question number 2 in appendix 1 for the wording of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secondary variable of interest goes by the variable name ioi and is
      referred to in shorthand as the index of interest. This is a 3-factor
      index which establishes a more general favorability measure of alternative
      education, whereas entry-level suitability is narrowly focused on the
      favorability of using alternative credentials in entry-level job
      application. The index of interest includes the variable of interest, and
      the two factors are strongly correlated, so general comments on
      favorability of alternative education should be considered a reference to
      both. Results for the index of interest were mainly uninteresting, as they
      were very much in line with an attenuated form of the results for the
      variable of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systematic analysis leveraged ordinary least squares regression analysis
      and identification of four key models for each administration year. The
      first model is a long model which involves multiple regression of every
      available right-hand variable. The second model of interest is the weak
      model which involves regressing all variables with a p-value less than .5.
      The third model is the adjusted r-squared maximizing model, and the fourth
      model, also called the strong model, involves regressing variables which
      have a p-value less than .1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systematic exploration began with the long model and variables were
      eliminated one at a time by significance until the next model of interest
      was discovered. The long model is interesting because it shows the maximum
      explanatory power of the available data set. The weak model is interesting
      because each variable which survives to this model is more likely than not
      to have an effect on the left-hand variable. The adjusted r-squared model
      is interesting because it balances between model complexity and
      explanatory power in a standard way. The strong model is interesting
      because it includes factors which have had an effect identified rigorously
      to a high degree of precision. With the probable exception of the long
      model, any of these models might be useful in varying applied business
      scenarios. While the long models seem to have high complexity relative to
      added value, it is interesting to note that the raw explanatory power of
      .5635 is greater than .5. This is important because it means the long
      model explains more of the variation than it fails to explain among the
      observations it is fit against.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the October 2018 administration variables are a superset of the
      February 2018 variables, a single systematic exploration was conducted
      concerning the 2018 administration year. Similarly, May 2019 variables are
      a superset of February 2019, and a single systematic exploration was
      conducted for 2019 variables. This analysis did not restrict the sample,
      however, and it turned out exegetically that the 2019 strong model holds
      for 2018 as well. That is, the most significant factors identified in the
      2019 samples were also measured in the 2018 administrations. This is
      likely a case of statistical endogeneity of significance, however, as
      these variables may be significantly identified precisely because they
      were oversampled.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-3-2-complexity-and-the-preferred-model">
      Section 3.2 – Complexity and The Preferred Model
    </h2>
    <p>
      4 of the 8 systematically derived models are reported in Table 3. Long and
      weak models are not recorded in the table for brevity, but factor strength
      across all models is reported in Appendix 4, and discussion is given to
      these models and their weak and super-weak factors when relevant. Adjusted
      r-squared maximizing models are also called medium models, and the
      variables in these models is considered to have medium importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, the 2019 medium model is preferred. It obtains high raw and
      adjusted explanatory power while maintaining relatively low complexity. It
      is not, however, the highest of all adjusted-r squared among the four
      models. The medium model including 2018-only variables had a higher
      adjusted r-squared. There are a couple potential reasons for this. First,
      variables which were included in 2018 and not included in 2019 are likely
      to contain important effects which would add to adjusted explanatory
      power. Secondly, there might be additional variation in the newer samples
      which would cause weaker fit even in the presence of 2018 variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initial investigation at the time of the 2018 survey administrations
      indicated that stem identification and religiosity were insignificant, so
      they were removed from later investigation. More recent replication of
      those results uncovered that those effects were moderately important, and
      inclusion in future research is recommended for reanalysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      During 2018 investigation, there was suspect improvement to simplicity
      when filtering by factor significance from the weak into the medium model.
      7 variables were eliminating, leading to nontrivial gain in adjusted
      r-squared, however the practical complexity of the matter did not
      significantly reduce because only one survey question could be eliminated
      in order to implement the medium model instead of the weak model. This is
      a different perspective on complexity which is an economically important
      distinction. As a result, a metric called q-complexity was checked for all
      models. This metric simply measures the number of questions which would be
      asked during a survey in order to implement a model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q-complexity is more directly connected to expenditure when constructing a
      survey or other data collection system, and it also more accurately
      assesses the interpretive complexity compared to adjusted r-squared in
      some cases. A model with 9 regional effects instead of 10 is unimportantly
      simpler compared to the reduction in complexity achieved when a survey
      with 9 yes or no questions is administered in comparison to a survey with
      10 such questions. Q-complexity detects this nuance while adjusted
      r-squared is blind to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This background is an important reason for selecting the 2019 medium
      model. The 2018 medium model decreased q-complexity by 1 relative to the
      2018 weak model, so practically the weak model is not more expensive to
      implement, and it may gain substantively in raw explanatory power. In the
      2019 case, however, the medium model reduces q-complexity from the 2019
      weak model by 4, or 25%, so it achieves an economically important
      reduction in implementation use and it is also substantively simpler to
      reason about.

    <p>
      There were 168 observations in the 2018 long model. Model hardening from
      the long model to the weak model for 2018 resulted in a reduction from 69
      to 39 variables. The 69 variables were associated with 15 questions, and
      the surviving 39 variables in the weak model were associated with 14
      questions. Surprisingly, the only question which was fully filtered out
      was the question on employment status.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original hypothesis was that employers would be willing to support
      alternative credentials. The systematically derived 2018 models indicate
      that the attitudes of those individuals who make hiring and firing
      decisions are not significantly different than the general population, but
      this simply begs a question about whether the general population supports
      alternative credentials. Appendix 3 answers this question by presenting
      summary data on all variables. The mean of the variable of interest is
      about 6.614, which is significantly more favorable than not across the
      population. Table 4 adds a bit of detail with respect to the specific
      sample included in the 2018 long and weak models. Individuals within this
      sample had an average favorability of about 6.351, although this is
      insignificantly different from average.

    <p>
      While cross tabulation within this sample seems to hint at weak positive
      temporal trend, direct interrogation of time variables yields a mixed
      confirmation. Simple regression of linear time on the variable of interest
      has a super-weak (p &gt; .5) negative effect. A regression of linear and
      squared time on the variable of interest yields stronger effects on each
      factor, but the effects are still weak (.5 &gt; p &gt; .1). Interestingly,
      the weak temporal effects are opposite expectation. Linear positive
      effects with a negative marginal effect would be intuitive, but the
      observed weak temporal effects are linearly negative and marginally
      positive. Positive marginal effects are generally considered
      unsustainable, but this finding may indicate that entry-level suitability
      resides on the early portion of an s-curve for adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
      When cubic time is introduced to the right hand, linear time becomes
      omitted due to collinearity. The p-values of marginal and cubic effects
      are slightly better than the p-values of the linear and marginal effects
      in the simpler model, but the marginal effect has a negative value in this
      model. Theoretically, as time increases arbitrarily the cubic effect would
      dominate, so that this model also suggests unbounded increasing returns to
      scale. As earlier mentioned, this is generally considered theoretically
      unsustainable, and so a more plausible interpretation of this temporally
      complex model is simply that it is replicating the suggestion that
      entry-level suitability exists at the early phase of an adoption growth
      curve, prior to inflection, sometimes called the lag phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on exploration up to this point, the working answer to the
      hypothesis is that employers are favorable toward using alternative
      credentials, but so is everyone else. In addition, there is weak evidence
      that exponential favorability is down the road, but favorability may
      decrease in the immediate future and for some time. The date construct
      used is the number of days since 1960. Time effect coefficients indicate
      that the total time effect will net positive with central estimates of
      80-120 years. The variety of events which could occur over such a time
      jeopardize reasonable confidence about the magnitude of these effects, and
      statistical significance in these effects is low enough that it would be
      unsurprising for inflection to obtain within 5 years. High variability in
      temporal estimation underscores the potential value of additional temporal
      sampling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reducing the weak 2018 model into the 2018 adjusted r-squared maximizing
      model eliminates Christian identification as an important variable. This
      variable competed with generic religious identification, and linear
      religiosity survives to this model with a positive effect. Religiosity is
      typically associated with political conservatism, and conservatism is
      thought to move with status quo bias. The present article gives mixed
      confirmation of a positive relation between religiosity and
      anti-innovation bias, but education appears to be an important exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Innovation proxy variables include favorability to artificial
      intelligence, cryptocurrency, and online education. These variables are
      cross-correlated with one another with a p-value of less than .001.
      Religiosity is negatively related only to artificial intelligence, but
      artificial intelligence is the only variable in this set of three which
      survives to the strong model. The negative linear correlation between
      religiosity and artificial intelligence is also more significant and
      larger in magnitude compared to the relation of religiosity to other
      innovation proxies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conservatism is characterized by high religiosity and high favorability to
      market-based solutions. Regulatory favorability is positively associated
      with all proxies of innovation. This amounts to confirmation on the
      association of market favorability with status quo bias, but it also
      presents two paradoxes. First, the market is considered an effective tool
      of innovation, so individuals seeking to maintain the status quo ought to
      disfavor it rather than favor it. Second, traditional education is
      regulated education, and alternative credentials are deregulated, so
      individuals committed to high levels of regulation ought to disfavor
      alternative credentials. One hypothesized explanation to this apparent
      paradox is oriented around individual personality. If those on the
      political left are high in openness, then they might also favor
      alternative credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Industrial effects are common in weaker models, but fail to survive into
      the strong model for 2018. The most significant industrial effect was for
      those who chose other as their industry. The second most significant
      effect was for information technology. Two regions have significant
      effects in the strong model. The mid-atlantic region, including much of
      Washington DC, is associated with a positive effect. The west south
      central region is associated with a large negative effect. This region
      consists of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. Gender, age, and
      income were significant. Anti-foreign bias was tested and identified, but
      it’s explanation is not intuitive. Anti-foreign bias is positively
      correlated with favorability on alternative education.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-3-4-systematic-exploration-of-the-2019-data-set">
      Section 3.4 - Systematic Exploration of the 2019 Data Set
    </h2>
    <p>
      The 2019 strong model identifies gender, innovation bias, expected
      conventionalism, online education favorability, and regulatory
      favorability as the strongest factors. Effects move in their expected
      directions, except for regulatory favorability which is linearly positive
      with respect to the entry level suitability. It’s interesting that the
      question about whether alternative credentials will be conventional soon
      survives into the strong model, because this reinforces two key
      theoretical stories in the literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, it highlights the importance of education as a norm, which is key
      to Caplan’s criticism of alternative credentials. Second, the surviving
      positive quadratic and negative cubic effects reinforces the story that
      alternative credential adoption is progressing through an s-curve. Figure
      3 shows the that the effect of expected conventionality on entry-level
      suitability follows an s-curve. This only reinforces our temporal story if
      time moves with expected conventionality, and indeed with nonlinear
      conventionality, but it turns out that this is exactly the case. While our
      earlier simple analysis of time on the variable of interest involved
      p-values on time variables in the neighborhood of .4, a regression of
      linear time on nonlinear expected conventionality reveals a positive
      coefficient with a p-value of .024.

      in the 2019 Strong Model
    </h2>
    <p>
      The vertical line in Figure 3 occurs at a value of about 6.1, which is the
      mean value of expected conventionality in the survey. Notice that this
      story about s-curve adoption is slightly different than our earlier story.
      The conventionality-based adoption analysis indicates that alternative
      credentials are past the lagged phase of adoption and recently past the
      point of inflection. Extrapolating far into the future seems to indicate
      an eventual demise to suitability, but this extrapolation is inappropriate
      for a few reasons. First, the model turns negative around an expected
      conventionality value of 11, but the maximum value this construct is
      capable of taking on is 10. At 10, we seem to see a marginal value near
      zero, which is consistent with the second extrapolation issue. In theory,
      we have good reason to expect decreasing marginal effects, but we have not
      identified any reason to expected negative marginal effects. Section 2.6
      discusses some of this theory on growth curves, learning curves, and so
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the shape of the curve is the result of analytical design.
      Quadratic and cubic factors were constructed rather than directly
      measured. These constructs are useful because they offer simple detection
      of non-linear effects, but not because they are optimal for all analytical
      purposes. S-curves are prototypically modeled as a sigmoid function, and
      log-log modelling is also common for learning or experience curves. While
      individuals are not treated and measured for learning in this paper, the
      idea is that society as a whole is learning about alternative credentials
      over time. Log-log regression for time on conventionalism was checked, and
      indeed it has an even better p-value of .004. Under that model there would
      be no extrapolative decline in entry-level suitability as a function of
      arbitrarily, indeed impossibly, large expected conventionality. For
      practical purposes there is little substantive difference in these
      approaches with respect to the variables in question. Expected
      conventionality is not binary, but transformation of this variable is
      possible to allow logistic regression to model a sigmoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Logarithmic analysis obtains higher confidence, but the relation is
      indirect to the variable of interest. Unfortunately, log-linear and
      log-log analysis of time directly to the variable of interest is
      super-weak, so the indirect relation seems to be both our most accurate
      story and also a relatively complex story to predict on and reason about.
      The log-linear regression of expected conventionality on the variable of
      interest is exceedingly significance with a p-value under .001, but it is
      less explanatory than a multiple regression of linear, quadratic, and
      cubic expected conventionality on the variable of interest, and in the
      longer regression all right-hand variables are significant with p-values
      under .08.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the direct relation between the variable of interest and time is
      insignificant, but each step of an indirect relationship is significant,
      an indirect model is tested by generating the predicted log of expected
      conventionality from log time, and the variable of interest is regressed
      on predicted log expected conventionality. Yet, this relation is also
      insignificant with a p-value of .811 for the predicted coefficient in the
      regression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, following the intuition of this indirect relation, nonlinear
      regressions are explored for significance. Eventually, three interesting
      models are identified. One strong temporal model was identified and two
      nonlinear regressions of expected conventionality on the variable of
      interest. A dynamic model was identified with the form:
    </p>
    <p>
      This temporal model obtained an r-squared of .8691 and b2 had a p-value
      less than .001. The estimate of b2 was less than 1, indicating exponential
      decay rather than exponential growth. This is the best fit temporal trend
      for the observed data, indicating a decreasing nonlinear trend in
      alternative credential suitability over the sample. Combining insights
      from 2018 and 2019 trend analysis, the evidence toward a short run
      reduction in alternative credential favorability is strong, and there is
      some comparatively weak evidence for a longer run reversal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding nonlinear regression of conventionality, a two-factor
      exponential expansion obtains an r-squared of .9029. Let X represent
      expected conventionality, then two-factor model takes the form:
    </p>
    <p>
      A three-factor exponential expansion obtains an r-squared of .2621. The
      three-factor model takes the form:
    </p>
    <p>
      The three-factor expansion is interesting because the exponentiated
      parameter is identified with a t statistic of 1077.23. This immense
      t-statistic seems to indicate the parameter is identified with high
      precision. However, the constant in this model takes the implausible value
      of about -171, and the exponentiated parameter takes the implausible value
      of about 175. Remember that the variable of interest is observed between 1
      and 10. The two-factor model estimates the exponentiated parameter at
      about 4. The two-factor model also estimates the exponentiated parameter
      with a t-statistic of about 33.8, and an associated p-value of about 0.
      While this lower t-statistic is technically a less strong identification,
      it is practically unimportant, and the estimated value is plausible.

      The positive association between conventionality and entry-level
      suitability is already firmly established, as is the short run negative
      association between time and the variable of interest. One interesting
      note to add is that when expected conventionality is interacted with time,
      a multiple regression of time, conventionality, and the interacted
      variable reveals a positive relation between the interacted variable and
      entry-level suitability. This may point to long run normalization of
      alternative credentials as a mechanism toward eventual recovery in
      entry-level suitability.

    <p>
      Employer effects refer to the effect associated with an individual’s
      statement that they influence hiring and firing decisions in their place
      of work. Employer effects were weak in the 2018 sample, but additional
      sampling across 2018 and 2019 allowed employer effects to survive into the
      preferred 2019 model. The preferred 2019 model is the model which
      maximizes adjusted r-squared. Employer effects are negative in that model,
      with a coefficient of about -.47. Employer effects are slightly negative
      to a lesser extent in a simple regression against the variable of
      interest, with a coefficient of about -.1.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple interpretation is that employers are more pessimistic than others
      on alternative credentials. Another interesting possibility views this
      effect from a process perspective. From a process perspective, employers
      are a driver of changes to the labor market, so that population
      favorability lags employer favorability. It’s clear that entry-level
      suitability will decline in the short term, and this is consistent with
      employers having a more negative view than average. The interesting
      finding here is to note that when we interact time with employer status,
      the employer effects are already reversed from the general population. A
      regression of four parameters on the variable of interest is depicted in
      Figure 4, which illustrates a hypothetical reversal in entry-level
      suitability. The figure is conceptual and not to scale. The population
      trend is illustrated at A, and employer views are represented at B. At A,
      time effects are linearly negative and marginally positive. Linear
      employer-time effects are positive, but marginal employer-time effects are
      negative. The plausibility of a reversal story is enhanced when noting
      that interacted manager-time effects are more positive than and
      significant compared to ordinary time effects.

      Other interesting findings from the 2019 data analysis includes the fact
      that age group had a more robust effect compared to exact age, which may
      indicate something like a cohort effect. Prior analysis indicated that
      regional effects were moderately important. Ethnicity was introduced into
      the survey in part to distinguish between underlying policy or culture
      partials of regional effects. Regional effects were significant after the
      introduction of ethnicity, but ethnic effects were also moderately
      significant. Future analysis could identify state of residence to partial
      out policy effects to a greater extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Educational attainment obtained an important effect which was more
      significant than either age or income effects. In addition to level of
      education, a dummy variable for whether education was at or greater than
      obtaining a college degree was found to be significant, and it had a
      positive effect on favorability to alternative education. It seems that
      individuals who have obtained a traditional degree are more appreciative
      of alternative education.

      Previous research found student indifference toward debt on the part of
      undergraduate students. The present paper replicates and extends such
      findings by identifying youth antagonism to alternative credentials. Prior
      research often measured debt attitudes among college students, but such
      evidence is susceptible to selection bias because debt-tolerant
      individuals might have a propensity to consume higher education. In
      contrast, the present paper identifies generalized youth antagonism to
      alternative credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple regression of exact age on the variable of interest yields a
      slight negative effect. Age group was more important than exact age, and
      including age group and exact age simultaneously replicates linear
      negative association across both variables. These regression results
      obfuscate a narrative which is readily apparent in Tables 5 and 6, a
      crosstab of age group on entry level suitability, and a summary of mean
      response to the variable of interest by age group. Notice that the most
      positive group is not the youngest group, but the age group actively
      attending or having just graduated college.
    </p>
    <p>
      30% of minors gave the lowest possible entry-level suitability response,
      and only 10% gave the highest response. Minors are the only age group
      which is unfavorable toward alternative credentials on average, with an
      average response of 4.6. One age group up, less than 3% of college-aged
      individuals gave a response of 1, while more than 20% gave a response of
      10. Entry-level suitability attenuates downward for age groups 3 and 4,
      but it is still positive on average. The oldest age group also has the
      highest proportion of individuals in maximal favor of alternative
      credentials, with about 1 in 4 giving a response of 10. The oldest age
      group has a strongly bimodal response, and they are on average less
      favorable than other groups except minors, but the pessimistic peak among
      the elderly is still favorable, at a value of 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngest group is a group of small sample size, and therefore not
      weighed heavily into the lines of best fit, and they are also the most
      pessimistic about alternative education. Contrary to the stereotype of the
      innovative youth against the in-their-ways elderly, the present paper
      indicates that the youth are less innovative than any other group. In the
      preferred model, which maximizes adjusted r-squared across all 2018 and
      2019 data, we see that educational effects are important, including a
      dummy variable for having received a college-level or better education.
      While neither age nor educational attainment survive into the strong
      model, educational effects are more significant in the preferred model. It
      seems that having been through the education system is the more
      explanatory factor, and age is a side-effect, rather than the other way
      around. The uneducated, including the youth, appear to be less innovative
      than the elderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This information provides for a better marketing strategy for alternative
      credentials. Instead of marketing to those about to enter college, market
      to their parents. Marketing to active college students is also a plausible
      path, although these students are already invested. Some approaches to
      alternative education, however, work in concert with traditional
      education. For example, credit by examination is an affordable, fast-paced
      alternative pathway toward a traditional degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plausible explanations for elderly favorability include memory of a time
      before the 1980s when a degree wasn’t as essential. These individuals have
      also often obtained a degree and worked for a substantial amount of time,
      and they may have noticed only a small attainment of job-related skills
      from the degree. Younger individuals may have a lack of skin in the game
      and a longer time horizon for repayment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another interesting, if tangential, result is that to the author’s
      knowledge, the present paper is the first to look at the effect of
      nonbinary gender identification on not only the variable of interest, but
      other items contained in the survey. Nonbinary gender identification
      obtained for 16 respondents, and it was motivated for inclusion by a
      desire to reduce noise in known gender effects, but it turns out to have a
      significant relation to the variable of interest by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple regression of nonbinary gender identification on the variable of
      interest reveals a coefficient of about -1.3 with a p-value less than .05.
      Gender nonbinary individuals are also pessimistic about online education,
      with a coefficient of about -1.1 and a p-value of less than .08 in that
      simple regression. Gender effects survive into the strong model, but not
      in the form of the nonbinary identification variable. Substituting
      nonbinary identification in for other gender variables in the strong model
      maintains the negative direction of effect, but the magnitude of effect is
      attenuated to -.48, this time with relatively low significance and a
      p-value of .374.
    </p>
    <p>
      A final interesting note is that every factor tested had at least one
      variable representation that was moderately significant in at least one of
      the administrations, with two exceptions. Collector effects were utterly
      insignificant, and Christian identification was weak at best. Ethnicity
      effects varied by ethnicity. Two were moderately important and none were
      strong. Hispanics, represented by isethnicity4, and also other
      ethnicities, represented by isethnicity6, were the two ethnicity variables
      present in the preferred model. Both ethnic effects were positive with
      nontrivial magnitudes of .87 and 1.68. These effects were nearly strong
      with a maximum p-value of .128 in the preferred model.

    <h2 id="section-4-applications">Section 4 - Applications</h2>
    <p>
      There are several important microeconomic applications of the present
      research. Key applications include accelerating and reducing cost for
      traditional education, improving employment and earnings through
      alternative credentials, individual application during the interview
      process, individual application in the context of corporate politics, firm
      application in competitive analysis, and individual application while
      facing the education consumption decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accelerating and reducing cost for traditional education can be
      accomplished in several ways. First, identify the average public in-state
      tuition for four-year public universities in the learner’s state of
      residence. Then, filter possible learning providers to ensure this is the
      maximum amount paid. Second, utilize online learning providers if the
      professional education desired support than, and if the learner is
      comfortable doing so. If the professional education desired involves
      hand-on experience, like science lab or medical, pure online solutions may
      not be ideal. Business, information technology, and liberal arts degrees
      are largely consumable online. Identify the learner’s desired career path
      and work backwards from that, taking note of relevant certifications, and
      directly pursuing certification as part of or in lieu of traditional
      education if possible. Leverage credit by examination and prior learning
      assessments when possible. Make it a goal to work while going to school
      and obtain employer reimbursement for college expenses to the maximum
      available amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the application process, an individual who has received alternative
      education should bear in mind the preferred model of alternative education
      favorability. The employment candidate will have opportunities to observe
      interviewers who will interview on behalf of the employer and contribute
      to an employment decision. The candidate can strategically communicate
      their educational history by observing interviewers and roughly
      calculating their favorability to alternative education.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the context of corporate politics, an individual may already be
      employed and may be seeking to garner consensus within the organization
      for a policy change. An example of a desired policy change might be to
      eliminate the requirement for a traditional degree from certain job
      requisitions, or to allow specific alternative credentials to substitute
      for that requirement in some cases. Many corporations offer thousands of
      dollars per employee in tuition assistance. A second example of a desired
      policy change might be to modify tuition assistance to target CLEP
      testing, so that recipients would be able to more quickly and cheaply
      obtain college credit, and potentially reduce assistance outlays from the
      employer. Bearing in mind the preferred model might assist a change
      advocate in identifying those individuals best predisposed to agreement
      with the change, facilitating consensus building and execution of that
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the two above scenarios, a key rhetorical strategy is to ask a person
      about whether they are familiar with alternative credentials. If they are
      not, talk a bit about them. After ensuring the concept is familiar,
      proceed to ask whether the person thinks these will soon become
      conventional. This is a key non-observable factor which is extremely
      explanatory in the model, but when asked in conversation it comes across
      in a non-technical, comfortable way. Handled properly, this question can
      be a good ice breaker and help the person asking the question to
      understand their audience without giving away the views of the person
      asking the question. The findings in the present paper indicate that
      people are receptive to alternative credentials even if they aren’t
      familiar with the topic, and that they become more favorable as they learn
      more. Outside of formal processes, these positive effects may indicate
      that conversation around alternative credentials is generally positive,
      and it might be applicable as ordinary leisure conversation material,
      which might eventually contribute to wider social acceptance by word of
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding competitive analysis from the firm perspective, particularly in
      the case of labor competition, firms already know that alternative
      education is important. People often learn about alternative learning
      providers through their employer. This is reflected in the findings from
      the present research in that unemployed status has a highly significant
      association with lack of knowledge about alternative learning providers.
      While employers are already driving alternative learning adoption, this
      kind of learning is typically used as a layer of professional learning,
      upskilling, or continuous education on top of a prior traditional degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The competitive trend is the tendency to allow that learning to substitute
      for the degree. This improvement to the prior human resource process
      allows access to a larger pool of qualified candidates who tend to accept
      offers at lower salary. Google was in early on this trend. In 2013, Laszlo
      Bock, Senior Vice President at Google, was interviewed by Adam Bryant of
      The New York Times. He stated that Google’s data at that time indicated
      that on the job performance was insignificantly related to GPA or test
      scores after 2-3 years, and the proportion of people without any college
      education at Google was increased over time. Years later, in 2018, a
      well-known salary aggregator called Glassdoor reported on 15 major
      companies, including Google, which no longer required a degree. Glassdoor
      stated, “Increasingly, there are many companies offering well-paying jobs
      to those with non-traditional education or a high-school diploma.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternative learning providers are also a key approach to improving
      workforce diversity. In order to align with other industry-leading firms,
      drive down labor cost, and improve workforce diversity, the present
      findings suggest a best practice policy is to marginally reduce
      traditional educational requirements in as many professional positions as
      feasible for a given firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Facing the education consumption decision includes at least two
      sub-scenarios. In one scenario the consumer is the student, and in another
      scenario the consumer is financing a third-party student. Typically, a
      financier would be a parent paying for their child to receive additional
      education, but there are many non-parental cases of third-party financing.
      Employers are a key example of non-parental education financing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important takeaway from the findings for individuals facing education
      consumption choices is that most people are favorable to the idea of
      alternative education, although we may soon enter a period where that
      favorability decreases substantially. Even facing lower favorability,
      though, it may still be worth exploring alternative credentials due to
      their affordability and rapid ability to attain. Finally, alternative
      education is broader than alternative credentials, and it’s possible to
      leverage alternative education as a way to accelerate or cheapen the
      completion of a traditional education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning while employed makes a learner a nontraditional student, but it
      greatly enhances the return to college. This for at least three reasons.
      First, because foregone earnings are a major college expense. Second,
      gaining experience allows the learner to obtain even higher earnings at
      graduation time. Third, many employers reimburse a significant amount of
      employee expenses toward college.
    </p>
    <p>
      This research also informs several potential macroeconomic policy
      enhancements. Federal lending programs, the G.I. Bill, and similar
      programs could be redirected, growth-limited, frozen, amended with a
      sunset provision, or terminated. Licensing regulation entailing formal
      education could be written to target evidence-based competency in lieu of
      accredited education. Internship requirements could be relaxed, or the
      minimum wage could be reduced. Finally, tax write-offs and tax-privileged
      investment vehicles targeted at accredited education could be liberalized
      to allow various forms of alternative education. While the present paper
      has focused on post-secondary credentials, it finds itself in harmony with
      a broad literature identifying favorable outcomes for school choice and
      self-directed learning at all ages.
