# Major Revisions Readme

A changelog. Section 1 is a high level change log. Section 2 a list of TODO items. Section 3 is a detailed changelog by paper entity.

### 1. High Level Change Log

1. Initial Draft.
2. Shrink and map to AEA convention.
   1. Use AEA LaTeX template.
   2. Format citations using BibTex.
   3. Split appendix into a seperated online appendix.
   4. Shrink from 34 pages to 18. Shrinking motivated by Bryan Caplan's feedback.
   5. Abstract to 91 words.
3. Comply with AER: Insights Submission Guidelines WIP
   2. Reduce size from about 6500 words to about 5500 words.
   3. Remove Background and Motivation section title.
   4. Reduce exhibits from 3 figures and 4 tables to 2 figure and 2 tables.
   5. Remove STATA code from footnotes.

### 2. TODO

1. Better online appendix and citation formatting.
2. Enlarge the paper's first letter
3. Pivot vertical axis figure labels 90 degrees, so they are vertical along the axis.
4. JEL codes should have parenthesis and no colon.
5. Title should have a cross superscript.
6. Running page header volume label is incorrect.
7. Abstract should not have a hanging indent.
8. Keywords should not appear in the paper.

Items 4-8 are built in to the AEA LaTeX template, which is recommended by AEJ, but it seems the template is at odds with the appearance of the 2019 AEJ Best Papers. Would this be something the library can assist with, should I reach out to AEJ/AEA themselves, or is there a better approach?
