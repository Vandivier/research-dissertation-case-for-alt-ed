Hey[if firstname: ' ' + firstname],

[if firstname: 'I got that name from Github, hope it's right.
']
I'm a PhD student with George Mason University and I'm researching alternative credentials.

Have you heard of Udacity Nanodegrees? I'm researching stuff like that. Even a Github portfolio can be considered an alternative credential.

You might be surprised to hear that academics really don't have good data on this stuff. Would you mind taking ~2 minutes to answer 10-12 questions?

Here's the link: [link based on collector-business-id]

I encourage you to share the survey with others, even if they aren't on Github.

If you want to hear about the results, just email me at john at afterecon.com.

Btw, feel free to add me on Github too [: https://github.com/Vandivier

Best,
John
