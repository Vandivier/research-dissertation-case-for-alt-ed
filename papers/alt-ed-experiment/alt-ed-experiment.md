3 - parents: survey on 10 alternative education strategies

survey high school students
should replicate their scales.

juniors and seniors didn't have sig diff results. planning best pratice indicates 6th, 9th, or even prior to having your first child.
"never too early and never too late"

surveys of kids at proper planning age becomes untenable with arbitrary youth, another reason to target parents.

but surveying young people in persons seems most effective.

“Minors” are individuals under the age of 13 (or under a higher age if permitted by the laws of their residence). SurveyMonkey does not knowingly collect personal data from Minors or allow them to register. If you are younger than 16 years old, you must be represented by your parents or guardians in order to agree to these Terms and to use the Services.

mechanical turk is 18+

treatments
1 - take the html sample class (supposed to show how easy coding is...)
2 - read 3 articles: free college, paid apprenticeships, and ???
3 - ??

survey:
1 - github folks - different collector...nvm that doesn't need to relate to this study, just alt cred
2 - students (current high school and undergrad)
3 - parents of students (#? age?)
i. call high school for high school student survey

pre/post is exclusively mturk, but that's ok bc we found collector effects don't matter, but this does rule out < 18yr olds by design. this is dangerous bc < 18 yr olds had importantly different attitudinal results so we should check if they have importantly different treatment effects (eg age group interacted with treatment - remember group was more important than continuous age)

hypothesis: parents are more susceptible to financial arguments than students themselves (isn't this already known? but ig i can replicate)
business model: financial advice and college planning. you pay me and I will tell you how to save money.

- removed exact age

- be sure to go over 2019maxar factors if this is the long paper where i extend (but that should be the other paper)
