* take existing credits as exogenous
* enrolled in NOVA, willing to earn alt credit they will accept.
    * CLEP, AP, DISSA, PLA (workforce experience in insurance)
* eventually considering a bachelor's in microbiology or biotechnology, but not doing that rn. maybe a master's later too.
    * strong preference to transfer to NC State...?
* not generally a fan of online learning; very concerned about not learning with physical labs by the bachelor's, wants an internship.
* NOVA associate's degree is Associate's in Science.
  * https://www.nvcc.edu/catalog/cat2018/academics/programs/programdetail.aspx?prog_id=4000&subprog_id=0&level=1
  * see degree plan csv for specific course-by-course planning (already done, alternative, or taking at school)
  * NOVA Associate's in Science is specifically made for transfer. See, for example the note on ITE 115. It is assumed the student is targeting a bachelor's degree plan at some other university. Because of ambiguity in NOVA to NC State transfer, there is a significant chance that ITE115 may end up being taken as a wasted class. NC State should be contacted to determine if another class is a better fit. In addition, it's not at all obv
* this plan is technically inefficient from the ROI perspective but it's optimal given preferences
    * I brought up like hey this would be easier from a different university you could do more CLEP, etc, but she wants these institutions arbitrarily
    * I think it would be an error for an advisor not to bring up alternatives (go straight to BS, skip associate, choose different schools), but I don't think it's an error for the advisor to optimize on *informed preferences* (informed in the sense that disclaimer was provided, understood, acknowledged, and then either agreed or dismissed conciously.)
* Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC) is listed as accepting Excelsior credit by exam
    * https://www.excelsior.edu/who-accepts-uexcel-credits
    * From NVCC's point of view, these are likely considered transfer credits https://www.excelsior.edu/exams/transfer-credits
    * Otherwise, NVCC might count them under credit by exam, or as part of a PLACE portfolio review: https://www.nvcc.edu/prior-learning/place.html
    * prepping for the exam might be tricky.
        * Obviously, one can simply take an excelsior course on statistics.
        * there are also official UExcel content guides: https://www.excelsior.edu/exams/get-ready
        * Excelsior offers a 'value package' of 'one practice exam, one official exam, and the extra insurance of a free retake':

        * One might also prep for AP Statistics to take the UExcel exam. There are plenty of official and non-official materials for that. Example: https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-statistics/course
        * Finally, Khan Academy is great on stats! However, those classes are ostensibly not aligned to UExcel courses as well as the official guides.
    * of importance to the associate in science degree, Statistics can be taken by UExcel instead of Calculus II in the classroom.
* Recommended Fulfillment Approach disregards transfer credit.
* Notes on Spanish CLEP:
    * May count for two semesters.
        * See https://clep.collegeboard.org/pdf/spanish-language-fact-sheet.pdf
        * According to the source above, "The American Council on Education has recommended that colleges grant six credits for a score of 50, which is equivalent to a course grade of C, on the CLEP Spanish Language exam, and nine credits for a score of 63. Each college, however, is responsible for setting its own policy. For candidates with satisfactory scores on the Spanish Language examination, colleges may grant credit toward fulfillment of a distribution requirement, or for a particular course that matches the exam in content. Check with your school to find out the score it requires for granting credit, the number of credit hours granted, and the course that can be bypassed with a passing score."
    * Easyness scores maybe biased by takers being actually bilingual or spanish.
    * Next easiest courses include Info Systems, Intro to Sociology, and Principles of Marketing. Considered easiest by http://www.dantes.doded.mil/EducationPrograms/get-credit/creditexam.html
    * NCSU doesn't take spanish clep https://admissions.ncsu.edu/apply/credit-opportunities/college-level-examination-program-clep/
    * However, looks like NCSU will transfer some NOVA spanish credit (2-11 credits) https://www.acs.ncsu.edu/php/transfer/
