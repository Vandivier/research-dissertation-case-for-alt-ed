Dear Dr. Taylor and AEL Editorial Team,

I'm pleased to submit "Preliminary Attitudinal Trends in Alternative Postsecondary Learning" for your consideration.

This paper contributes to the education economics literature, and more specifically to build on "The Case against Education" Caplan 2019 and "A New U" Craig 2019.

The paper follows an unbalanced panel survey design with an interesting data set consisting of 100+ right hand variables.

The idea here is simple: How can we optimize the return to higher education? A partial answer is through alternative postsecondary education.

Caplan posits a catch-22 with such education: conformity signal becomes nonconformity stigma when a learner eschews the traditional route.

At the same time, alternatives are cheaper for learners and may endow more practical skills valued by employers. So which effect dominates?

Prior literature like Craig's work has audited alternative programs in an ad-hoc way. This paper takes a broad look at learner and employer favorability and related underlying factors.

The answer seems to be that adoption is a complex process, but it is increasing over time and there are firm, policy, and individual activities which can expedite the process.

One accelerator is simple dissemination of information. My work indicates that familiarity with alternative education is associated, and indeed seems causal, with favorability to alternative education.

Publishing this piece would constitute an act of dissemination of information, nudging the academy, policymakers, employers, and learners to adopt better access and quality at lower prices, through technologies like alternative learning practices.

I confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal.

I have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to Applied Economics Letters.

Best,
John Vandivier
