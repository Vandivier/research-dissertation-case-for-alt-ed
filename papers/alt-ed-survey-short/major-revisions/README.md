# Major Revisions README

v1
1. Create a shortened, preliminary version of alt-ed-survey. See `/papers/alt-ed-survey/major-revisions/README.md` for more info.
2. Rejected by Economics Letters on Nov 24 2019 as #EL48053
3. Evaluation notes: `While this is interesting data the paper is not sufficiently substantive for EL and I am not sure exactly what we are supposed to take away from the study. Moreover, I am not convinced that the data collection ensure representativeness.`

v2 (TODO: SHA)
1. Address rejection notes and submit to Applied Economics Letters.
2. Alter title to `Preliminary Attitudinal Trends in Alternative Postsecondary Learning` to distinguish from the forthcoming longer version with prediction validation.
