# the point of this file is: hey, you identified which factors are important but
# what are their directions of effect?
# TODO: use LOOCV-WX model l1_ratio=0.0001 as starting point
# try reducing high p-value factors, 1-by-1 until we get an optimized AIC and adjusted r2
# convinient that n < p in this case, so we can to RFE manually (bc automated lacks ar2 maximization algo)
