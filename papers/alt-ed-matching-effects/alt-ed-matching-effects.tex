A substantial gap exists between the skills expected by employers and those possessed by college graduates\cite{mcgarry2016examination, malik2017great, abbasi2018analysis, gingras2000there}.
Experts view college alternatives including vocational school as useful for technical training, but the traditional college degree retains a wage premium over vocational education.
Unemployment, underemployment, and other negative labor outcomes follow a similar pattern\cite{smith_2011}.
This paper seeks to resolve the apparent descrepancy between these outcomes while preserving the mainline view that employers pay for perceived job candidate skill.
% or expected marginal revenue product of labor
To explain the apparent descrepancy,
this paper tests the hypothesis that employers expect an offsetting non-technical skill deficit when considering an alternatively credentialed non-college graduate (ACNG).
I find evidence that the general population of the United States, including employers, does apply a stigma to the ACNG in which soft skills are assumed to be deficient.

Alternative credentials refer to credentials other than the undergraduate degree\cite{brown2017complex}.
The category includes, for example,
industry certifications,
portfolios of work,
% transcripts of accredited or unaccredited course work,
digital badges, and other records of unaccredited learning and achievement.
Individuals pursuing alternative credentials typically intend to leverage the credential toward better employment.
That is, they typically have the same goals as a college student.
Many individuals obtain alternative credentials as a supplement to the college degree.
Such a situation is pareto-superior to degree attainment alone and is therefore intentionally excluded from analysis.
This paper focuses on the comparatively interesting case of alternative credentials as a substitute to the college degree in order to diagnose comparative disadvantage at the skill level.
If a specific set of skills effectively explain labor outcome differences,
% as opposed to a broad set of skills each weakly explaning some difference,
then alternative learning providers could update products to affect better outcomes for their consumers.

% Alternative credentials can be obtained quickly and cheaply relative to college.
% Obtaining a college degree signals intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity,
% but it may not signal technical skill\cite{horton_2020}.
% Alternative credentials signal technical skill.
% As such, they provide an effective supplement to the college degree.

% This paper is concerned with another use case in which the college degree is entirely substituted.
% In that situation, employers may apply a noncollege stigma.
% This is particularly the case for roles which are typically occupied by degree holders.
% Noncollege stigma is a presumption, expectation, or bias toward perception of a skill gap of a certain kind.
% Whether the gap exists in fact is out of the scope of the present paper.

% Technical skill generally implies intelligence.
% Alternative credentials, then, fail to signal two qualities compared to the college degree.
% Alternative credentials fail to signal conscientiousness and conformity.
% Interestingly, some employers may demand some level of nonconformity.
% Employers may also presume a certain lack of soft skill on the part of highly technical applicants.
% % Finally, employers may use alternative credentials as a proxy for other employee characteristics like income, education, race, and gender.

% % a missing link for future research: hirability only correlates with actual hiring decisions it isn't a hiring decision
% Hiring decisions reflect boundedly rational demand for skilled labor.
% The college degree and alternative credentials provide two qualitatively distinct signals of skilled labor.
% The hirability of individuals in possession of these credentials has been studied,
% but the underlying determinants are not clear.
% This paper hypothesizes that perceived skill gaps are important determinants of hirability.
% This paper further hypothesizes that perceived skill gaps are qualitatively different between college graduates and others.
% % In particular, this paper hypothesizes that a noncollege stigma is obtained for candidates without a degree in pursuit of roles typically filled by degree holders.
% % soft skill bias in particular

% three interesting follow-on questions:
%   1. do employers have such a bias
%   2. is such a soft skills gap presumption actually true
%   3. if true, due employers overvalue the soft skills gap
% related paradox: most people won't be in a job for 4-5 years,
% so why do they need to show conscientiousness and conformity towards the 4-5 year bachelor's goal line?
% hard skill stigma: in my experience, people who are highly technical are hard to work with
% soft skill bias: I am favorable bc i think u have soft skills (and maybe this is efficient...enter eq/iq discussion)

% This paper tests the hypothesis that there is a lack of hirability an ACNG (ACNG) is explained by an offsetting perceived lack in non-technical skills.
% In particular, this paper hypothesizes that ACNGs are seen as nonconformist and lacking in soft skills or non-technical skills.
% These deficits explain why an ACNG would not be a preferred source of labor in many cases,
% even if such a candidate does possess superior technical skill.

% technical skill has negative coefficient but magnitude and reliability (p-value/variance) are weaker; overall, less important effect
% hypothesis stems from signalling model.
% This paper proposes skill gaps are perceived in particular among soft skills for alternatively educated individuals.
% one might argue employers are mistaken here; technical work may involve higher, not lower, conscientiousness; ya maybe but out of scope.
% that is, we test social stigma and skill-level / decomposed stigma; an application of the signlaing model.

% Experts view college alternatives including vocational school as useful for technical training, but the traditional college degree retains a wage premium over vocational education.
% This paper hypothesizes that employers pay for skill.
% As a result, lower wages for technically skilled individuals are hypothesized to derive from an offsetting perception of skill deficit elsewhere.
% That is, this paper hypothesizes that employers view an ACNGs (ACNG) as lacking in soft skills.
% This paper hypothesizes that employers expect a skill deficit, although not a technical skill deficit, 
% This expected deficit explains the variance in labor outcomes.

% Sustained rising costs to higher education motivate periodic review of the return to the college degree.
% Despite rising costs, Americans have become more educated than expected over the past decade.
% Trades have contemporaneously seen a labor shortage.

% actually, trade school enrollment is increasing faster than undergraduate enrollment

% By 2020, They Said, 2 Out of 3 Jobs Would Need More Than a High-School Diploma. Were They Right?
% overinvestment in college seems to cause a technical labor shortage, but the market is compensating by enrolling more technical folks too
% https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/03/choosing-trade-school-over-college/584275/

% it is not the case that employers are increasingly demanding the college degree, but it is the case that many do today. Let's examine their reasons.
% peak college?

% An undergraduate degree is a historically reputable investment.
The signalling model has become one of the two standard explanations of the value of the college degree.
Signalling theory provides three advantages over human capital theory for the purposes of the present study.
First, signalling theory is able to explain labor outcome variance when human capital is held constant.
% First, signalling theory is able to explain labor outcome variance across labor types when skills are totally equal.
% Under a human capital model, in contrast, a variety of labor outcomes would directly imply variance among input labor.
% The present paper expects that skills for the ACNG compared to other labor types are not totally equal, but this must emerge as a result rather than a presumption.

Second, the signalling model empowers a questionnaire research design.
In an idealized human capital model, the measures of human capital would correspond to production process inputs.
To establish a wide array of such skill measures would be complicated and prone to measurement sensitivies, assumptions, and errors of various kinds.
In this framework, a questionnaire is a second-best design which provides a proxy for the functional measure of skill.
Signaling theory takes the reverse approach.
According to the signalling model, labor demand is formed on the basis of job candidate value as perceived by an employer.
In this framework, a questionnaire is ideal.
% In this framework, a questionnaire is a direct measure of the functional construct, which is the opinion of the employer.
The manner is in which employer perception relates to job candidate technical skill, if at all, is secondary.
An additional benefit of using a questionnaire is the ability to ask hypothetical questions.
In pondering hypotheticals, employer evaluation of a credential or signal can be isolated from the human capital variance which occurs in actual job candidates.

Third, signalling theorists have laid out a testable hypothesis for weak labor outcomes among non-college graduates.
Following this model, scholars claim that the college degree signals intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity\cite{caplan2018case}.
% Since immediate college enrollment is the normal course of action for high school graduates,
Non-traditional education, in contrast, is hypothesized to signal nonconformity.
Non-traditional courses can be completed in a shorter span of time and with reduced entry qualifications relative to the traditional degree.
For this reason, alternative credentials are thought to signal low concientiousness relative to the college degree.

% Proponents of the signalling model often prefer employer-oriented explanations of college enrollment.
% In this explanation, employers prefer college graduates because the college degree signals intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity.
% While a technical credential signals intelligence and technical skill, the absence of a degree yields a perceived gap in the mind of the employer.
% There is a perceived comparative lack on the part of the non-college graduate with respect to conscientiousness and conformity.
% This paper tests this hypothesis.

% An agent-based explanation would be that high school graduates are not taught about these alternatives.
% The college degree is popular, has a well-defined return, and is low in risk.
% Particular alternative programs are obscure and often lack a well-defined return.

% Other research indicates that concientiousness and conformity are not always desirable labor qualities.
% There is some reason to doubt the hypothesis that lower perceived value is attributable to signaling differences in concientiousness and conformity.
% Research indicates that extreme values for either factor in either direction may be detrimental to productivity.

% TODO: long paper food...uncomment below section as it implies we should be doing marginal analysis. Then do marginal analysis, and K*K skill interactions
% TODO: maybe move to results section when we talk about concientiousness
% Research indicates a goldilocks level or bliss point for both concientiousness and conformity is likely to exist.
Research indicates the existence of bliss points for employee concientiousness and conformity from the point of view of an employer.
Excess individual concientiousness can disturb team performance\cite{curcseu2019personality}.
Conformity can lead to a lack of innovation and suboptimal organizational practices\cite{symon2006neglected}.
% Psychologists also state that
Conformity selection occurs in part through heuristic decisioning rather than conscious choice.

% Because a single measure operationalizes each of these effects and their own negation, a fixed sample size is relatively unlikely to identify an important coefficient.
% Because these factors are sometimes demanded and in other cases the inverse is demanded, a factor coefficient may be harder to identify and may only represent the average effect, even if the average effect is hardly predominant in practice.

% The psychological problem is related to but distinct from the pure logical problem that a totally conformed mind is necessarily incapable of innovation.
% Firm innovation requires an underlying capacity for individual innovation.
% Firms must have some capacity for innovation to sustain profit in a growing economy.
% Even if conformity selection is a correct explanation of ACNG aversion, then, it may not be an ideal practice when viewed through the lense of technical or economic efficiency.
% Risk aversion is compatible with a sometimes-concious, sometimes-heuristic decisioning model.

% Innovators, leaders, and high-performers are three kinds of virtuously nonconformant labor.
% Because conformity is sometimes undesirable and sometimes desirable,
% the effect may neutralize itself in an ordinary OLS stastistical analysis.
% The effect may not be identified as important or significant in any particular direction.

Risk aversion is a distinct explanation for conformity selection.
An employer may not be able to evaluate an alternative credential with confidence.
From the point of view of such an employer, an ACNG may range in value from a positive outlier to a negative outlier.
The employer may not prefer to hire such a candidate on the basis of risk aversion,
even if their point estimate for ACNG labor value is higher than their point estimate for a recent college graduate.
% To preview a particular result, this paper finds that large employers are particularly willing to hire an ACNG.
If employers with many employees are positively associated with ACNG hirability, this will add weight to an explanation based on risk aversion.
% Reasons for this include: 1) failure to deliver can be catastrophic, so low performers may be disproportionately untolerable.
% Revenue consistency, timeline, reputation, quantity produced targeting, large min skill labor cost and marginally small pay increase to achieve adequate production.
% Performance monitoring and turnover costs reinforce this
% zb states I'm assuming constant cost per hire...actually I allow that some portion of large-firm hirability is due to better ability to distinguish low vs high
% other than that effect, the remainder would be attributable to risk aversion.
% yes, the null hypothesis is no difference in cost per hire; but I can also support that which I suspect...turnover costs are proportionally smaller for large firms
% these firms are able to specialize and economize in hiring, plus they are more likely to have high-skill candidates that can better interview and recruitment tech+processes that scales
% TODO: long paper food... consider below articles and flesh out the risk aversion to firm size interaction thing
% note turnover cost calculation is complex but we proxy of just cost to hire. A + B below support cheaper for large firms. (C reinforces B)
%   A) "As stated in a study by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, hiring an employee in a company with 0-500 people costs an average of $7,645."
%   B) "Another study by the Society for Human Resource Management states that the average cost to hire an employee is $4,129, with around 42 days to fill a position."
%   C) "According to Glassdoor, the average company in the United States spends about $4,000 to hire a new employee, taking up to 52 days to fill a position."

% https://toggl.com/blog/cost-of-hiring-an-employee
% The highest performing employers, however, will be able to distinguish desirable from undesirable candidates within the unconventional pool.
% Risk aversion varies naturally among firms. <- probably don't write this line in paper as a reviewer can always posit there is a further reason you are missing
% Some employers that are high in risk aversion will provide a net preference to ACNG due to nonconformity preference.

% TODO: long paper food...below section is part of intro or perhaps model...
% \subsection{Process Explanations of Suboptimal Wages}

% Basic price theory holds that an employer should pay wages equal to the marginal revenue product of labor.
% In the real world, measuring candidate productivity at hiring time is costly and imperfect.
% % This produces a technical error which assumes alignment between the goals of the firm and a hiring team.
% A further issue is identified when the hiring team is scrutinized for principal-agent problems.
% The hiring team is composed of individuals with preferences, calculative limitations, and other biases.
% Monitoring and correcting for these problems is expensive,
% so firms will heterogenously realize some aggregation of these individual definiciencies.

% Exacerbating the already necessarily imperfect hiring process are candidate-side problems.
% Firms must hire among a finite, potentially small, number of candidates.
% Risk aversion to time expense and other search costs may lead a firm to approve a suboptimal candidate\cite{simon1976substantive}.
% In some cases, candidate pools may be systematically problematic.
% In law and medicine, for example, extensive education and training are legally required.
% These policies further restrict the candidate pool, inflate expected wages, and systematically alter the content of education in a politically-motivated manner.
% Market forces implement hiring as a lumpy expenditure process to begin with, but certification requirements, wage regulation, and other policies extend the problem.

% The prior discussion highlights many locations of hiring process inefficiency.
% The practical importance of magnitudes and kinds of such effects are described in a legion of related papers.
% A meager sampling of five such effects would include the attractiveness effect and many other issues related to gender bias\cite{quereshi1986physical},
% agentic behavioral stigma\cite{steffens2009feminization},
% and complex biases related to communication style\cite{brouer2017gender, nijs2019effects, sampugnaro1983nonverbal}.
% Sung et al find that impression management meaningfully weakens disability stigma\cite{sung2017disclose}.
% These tactics are transferable in part to noncollege stigma mitigation.
% Finally, there are a wealth of concerns about the effects of social media.
% For one, it presents a channel for the revival of religious discrimination\cite{esposito2018signalling}.

% In the face of so many important inefficiencies, one begins to wonder whether the original theory holds any water at all.
% Papers which identify matching effects, including the present paper,
% serve to limit the proportion of explanation attributable to bias and redeem the elementary price theory story to some extent.
% Prior work demonstrates the important of matching effects in the form of norm compliance\cite{francesco1981gender}.
% Meta-accuracy is a kind of matching measure, and it has been shown to move positively with hirability\cite{renier2018no}.

% Five student-oriented explanations include an inflated perception of the return to college,
% lack of awareness about alternative programs,
% social pressure to pursue college over alternatives,
% inability to confidently compare returns to alternatives,
% and risk aversion which favors college as a low-risk option despite high cost.


\section{Data and Methodology}
% note: description of data / model / methodology: one section in a short paper; can be broken into seperate sections for a long paper...or can it? seems kinda intertwined
% for this paper: methodology [i. model / method of analysis, ii. description of data collection iii. additional description of data as needed at factor level]
% I don't feel the need to spell out an OLS model equation unless requested by a reviewer
% I don't feel the need to spell out the risk aversion model equation unless requested by a reviewer (it's just a signal multiplier on actual skill which varies by credential and employer)
% the risk aversion model i feel is more interesting, but it would be an inappropriately high level of focus and detail for an item of secondary interest

% The method of this study begins with a decomposition of the main hypothesis into three simple statistical tests.
% This study applies the three-step method to the case of the ACNG, but the three-step method itself is sufficiently general to apply to any measurably distinct job candidate type.
% First, skill gaps are identified as independent factors with a general ability to explain hirability.
% Second, the coefficient for a
% Finally, gaps in soft skills are hypothesized to be more important than technical skill gaps.
% If the above three conditions hold, ACNG labor dispreference can be explained with or without comparing labor outcomes to the college graduate.

The hypothesis in this paper is based on a simple model of demand for labor which is clarified in Equations \ref{eq1} and \ref{eq2}:

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        % maybe S is not S_j showing S is a non-person-specific credential
        % but I like S_j because it is *those credentials possessed by j* which can be a unique collection + unique work history, other unique signal, etc...
        S_j = f(H_j)
        \label{eq1}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        w_{ij} = E_i(MRP_j) = f_i(S_j)
        % alternatively, D_i(L_j) = E_i(MRP_j) = f(S_j, i)
        \label{eq2}
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Job candidate $j$, generates a signal of productivity, $S_j$ from unobserved human capital, $H_j$.
Employer $i$, forms an expectation of the marginal revenue product of $j$ on the basis of $f_i(S_j)$, an employer-specific evaluation of $S_j$.
A specific employer is willing to pay a specific job candidate wages of $w_{ij}$.

This study uses ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to estimate the effect of perceived skill gaps on hirability.
An employer is willing to pay more for a relatively hirable individual.
This makes hirability a proxy of demand for labor and $w_{ij}$.
% this is questionable because hirability is technically the willingness to execute a wage integrated over some expected time period (average employee tenure)
% but then, that integrated wage would just be wage multiplied by some constant and we would need to divide by some constant since hirability is a probability
% so, hirability should correlate directly to wage after all
% you also might say hirability is theoretically closer to an estimate of productivity...but who cares it's once again equal
% and we want to frame the overall model as a simple labor demand model.
%
% Equally, a respondent is making an expected productivity statement when scoring hirability
% This study presumes that employers are willing to pay less for an ACNG.
% This study also presumes that ACNG labor has better technical skill.
In order to explain reduced willingness to pay for ACNG labor relative to college graduate labor,
this paper hypothesizes that employers preferentially value soft skills in the course of $f_i(S_j)$.
To provide evidence for preferential evaluation of soft skills by employers,
one or more soft skills should yield a negative coefficient
% of an economically important magnitude
in a regression on hirability.

% The hypothesis that employers associate soft skill deficiency with ACNG labor is based on a simple model of labor demand.
% As such, the top-level model is a model of demand for labor.
% This is how we derive the hypothesis of offsetting deficiencies from a lower ACNG wage.

% To address this question,
Regression analysis in this study is conducted using original cross-sectional data from an online self-completed questionnaire ($n = 212$).

The survey includes 65 questions in two sections\footnote{See Appendix A for a full copy of the survey.}.
The first section captures respondent characteristics and the second section captures perceived skill relative to hypothetical job applicants.
Employer responses did not significantly differ from the general population,
so respondent characteristics are also interpreted as employer characteristics.

Regression variables in this study are categorical or Likert-type responses based on a scale from 1 to 10.
% \footnote{
%     OLS classically supposes cardinal, interval, or continuous data.
%     Likert-type responses are generally considered ordinal data, but they can be interpreted as cardinal for a few reasons.
%     First, rounding is an inevitable measurement constraint.
%     A continuous response from 0 to 1 which rounds to the first decimal is technically statistically and mathematically isomorphic to,
%     or indistinguible from,
%     a 10 point Likert-type response.
%     Jaccard and Wan\cite{jaccard1996lisrel} note that severe departures from the assumptions on cardinality "do not seem to affect Type I and Type II errors dramatically."
%     They find departures are particularly nonproblematic for Likert scales with 5 or more points.
%     Finally, treating Likert-type responses as continuous is structurally defensible in this particular study.
%     The notion that Likert-type responses are purely ordinal would make the notion of marginal effect absurd and incalculable,

Higher Likert-type values indicate greater agreement with a statement that varies by variable.
Categorical variables include state of residence,
industry of occupation,
employer status,
firm size,
and a measure called duration.

Duration measures the length of time the respondent believes it takes to obtain an alternative credential.
Employer status describes whether an individual makes hiring and firing decisions in the course of their employment.
The variable takes one of three values: yes, no, or unemployed.
Employer effects refer to the case where an individual states that they do make hiring and firing decisions.
State of residence refers to a state within the United States.
Respondents were allowed to select the District of Columbia as a state of residence,
but no such responses were obtained.

Three other factor groups are investigated in the regression analysis.
These variables are measured using Likert-type units and they include hirability,
rulebreaker effects,
and perceived skill gaps.
Hirability is the dependent factor and it indicates the degree of agreement that, "For many professions, alternative credentials can qualify a person for an entry-level position."

% The unit of factor coefficients for nonconformists and skill gaps is hirability per Likert-type unit, where hirability is also a Likert-type unit.
% Rulebreaker effects refer to a collection of three factors that describe the way employers think about nonconformists, or "People who are willing to break formal or informal rules and norms."
Rulebreaker effects refer to a collection of three factors that measure respondent agreement with statements about nonconformists, or "People who are willing to break formal or informal rules and norms."
% The three rulebreaker questions measure respondent agreement with statements 
The first statement indicates that nonconformists present a risk to the reputation, productivity, or value of a company.
This statement received the least agreement and greatest response variance among three qualitatively different descriptions of people that are willing to break rules ($\mu = 6.40, \sigma = 2.55$).

The second statement indicates that nonconformists are held back by rules and "could just as easily be high performers as low performers."
% The second statement indicates that people break rules which hold them back, and that nonconformists "could just as easily be high performers as low performers."
% MAYBE TODO: standard error instead of or in addition to standard deviation. maybe make a table since there are at least three cases of similar report.
This statement received the most agreement and least variance among rulebreaker statements ($\mu = 7.42, \sigma = 1.91$).
The agreement with this statement provides evidence against the thesis that employers value conformity for its own sake.
In turn, this adds weight to the theory that employers value conformity as a risk aversion tactic while knowing that nonconformity signals positive outlier potential.
The third description of nonconformists states that they tend to be gifted in the areas of innovation or creativity,
and that such people may benefit the culture of a company ($\mu = 7.25, \sigma = 2.03$).

% Perceived skill gaps are computed from perceived skill questions in the second section of the survey.
% % Respondents do not directly report perceived skill gaps.
% % Instead, responses indicate perceived skill level for particular skill and a particular type of job candidate.
% % 13 skills are analyzed and 4 job candidate types are surveyed, for a total of 52 questions in the second section on perceived skill.
% % MAYBE TODO: citation to "make response anchoring appropriate"
% % Each section begins with a contextual message to normalize response anchoring.
% % Questions are provided in nonrandom order for the same reason.
% % Data from the second section is used to calculate perceived skill gaps.

% Raw perceived ACNG skill gaps are calculated by differencing the perceived skill of an ideal candidate with the perceived skill of an ACNG.
% % technically, the actual skill of an ideal candidate equals the perceived skill so the adjective is extraneous; but let's be consistent and not confuse reader.

Perceived skill gaps are computed two ways from perceived skill questions in the second section of the survey.
Perceived skill gaps are measured seperately with and without overqualification effects.
Overqualification effects have been identified as important in external research\cite{green2007there, raybould2005over}, but these effects are sometimes ignored during skill gap analysis\cite{blake_2018}.
% MAYBE TODO: cite more than 1 person who ignores overqualification

Perceived skill is a Likert-type response reporting agreement with the statement that a particular candidate has a particular skill.
For each of 13 skills, the respondent is asked to imagine and report skill levels for the ideal candidate,
the average actual employee,
the average recent college graduate,
and the average ACNG.
% For each of 13 skills,
Raw perceived ACNG skill gaps are calculated by differencing the perceived skill of an ideal candidate with the perceived skill of an ACNG.
The perceived skill gap with overqualification effects equals the raw perceived skill gap.
The perceived skill gap without overqualification effects is calculated as the raw skill gap or zero if the raw skill gap value is negative.
% MAYBE TODO: just have one dependent variable and don't mention the other. it's something i did at analysis time, but may be confusing in the paper.

Rulebreaker effects and perceived skill gaps are structurally linked.
Respondents are asked to evaluate the soft skill of nonconformity, or "willingness to break formal or informal rules and norms."
% This question is a measure of the soft skill of nonconformity.
%, which is the inverse of conformity.
% Structurally, nonconformity interacts with employer disposition to rulebreaking.
Nonconformity interacts with employer disposition to rulebreaking.

The identified model will support the hypothesis if soft skills are more important than technical skill gaps. % and negatively affect ACNG hirability.
The model will support the risk aversion explanation of ACNG hirability over an explanation from conformity selection if large employer size is positively associated with hirability.
% If employers preferentially value soft skills then soft skill gaps should be identified as important and negatively relate to ACNG hirability.
% MAYBE TODO: I said this earlier in this same section...am I referencing the main hypothesis too often or is it healthy?
% MAYBE TODO: I also expect signs to be generally negative and soft skills should be statistically significantly less for ACNG compared to recent college graduate
% MAYBE TODO: rulebreaker effects and firm size effects also contribute to solutioning the risk aversion hypothesis

Comparative analysis provides additional confidence in the data by replicating the hirability gap between ACNG labor and recent college graduates reported in external research.
A comparative skill gap variable is constructed for each perceived skill gap that is important in the preferred hirability model.
Comparative skill gap variables are constructed by subtracting perceived recent college graduate skill from perceived ACNG skill.
Multiple regression of these comparison factors on hirability demonstrates which, if any, perceived skill gaps are important distinguishers of the ACNG from the college graduate.
Identification of significant differences with a negative total effect on hirability will replicate external data on the lower job market value of ACNG labor
and provide a diagnostic on which skill or skills must be better addressed through alternative learning programs.

% This paper acknowledges that own analysis proceeds through a technocentric lens.

% The technocentric lens is an important caveat and anchoring point, but I argue that it is about as proper as any anchoring point.
% In economics, after all, technology operationalizes the theory of innovation per se.
% All skills can be viewed as point-in-time innovations, so that if there was no innovation then neither would there be a need for any skill.
% By the same token, a technocentric lens at the present seems close to a cross-industry lens at a future time.
% Anchoring to any other industry would be both asymmetric and unusuful in the future.
% Perhaps this analysis is slightly skewed, but at least it is skewed only against the past, and will be increasingly useful in the future without partiality to any particular industry.
% In addition, we did check for industrial effects, but the analytical skew may persist pass the data.

\subsection{Identification of the Preferred Model}

Results confirm that employers, and the population in general, associate a soft skill deficit with ACNG candidates.
Employer status was associated with an insignificant positive coefficient on hirability.
Hirability was generally positive ($\mu = 7.57, \sigma = 1.80$) and depends critically on rulebreaker effects.
% The mean response was 7.5 on a scale from one to ten ($\sigma = 1.80$).
% Hirability critically depends on rulebreaker effects.
Rulebreaker effects have more explanatory power than perceived skill gaps,
and perceived skill gaps have more explanatory power than widely recognized factors like state of residence and industry of occupation.
Duration effects, positive nonconformity selection,
and the lack of important differences in conformity between ACNG and college graduate labor
provide support for an explanation of ACNG hirability based on risk aversion rather than positive conformity selection.

% TODO: long paper food...make tab:table_new_ols include all model factors
Table \ref{tab:table_new_ols} reports statistics for five multiple regressions.
Coefficients are reported for selected variables for brevity.
Selected variables include rulebreaker effects and any perceived skill gap which is important in any specification.
In these models, an important factor is one that improves the adjusted explanatory power of the model when included.
These factors are not constrained to have a p-value less than 0.1, but as a rule of thumb they happen to have a p-value less than 0.3.
Of the thirteen perceived skill gaps tested, eight were important in at least one specification.
Seven skill gaps were important in Model 5, the preferred model.
An important interaction between the information technology industry and perceived body language communication skill was also identified.

% n=212
\begin{table}
    \caption{Table of Coefficients for Multiple Regressions on Hirability, Selected Variables}

    }

\end{table}

Model 1 allows for overqualification and Model 2 uses the perceived skill gap measures that exclude overqualification effects.
Models 3 and 4 are equivalent to models 1 and 2, respectively, after normalizing for industry, state, and firm size effects.
Effect normalization involves retaining those factors which are robust across both models 1 and 2.
For example, Alabama has a significant effect when overqualification is allowed in Model 1.
The effect for respondent residence in the state of Alabama is insignificant when overqualification is excluded in Model 2.
Because Alabama is sensitive to this specification change, it is considered nonrobust and excluded after normalization.
Employer status was positive in all models, but it was only significant in models 1 and 2.
Significance loss on employer status during normalization
suggests that the effect of employer status on hirability critically interacts with industry,
state of residence, and firm size, which are the normalized effects.

Model 5 is specified as Model 4 plus two adjustments.
First, the factor for salary is dropped.
The salary factor improved adjusted explanatory power in Model 2, but it provided no such benefit in any other model.
Moreover, the p-value of this factor was unacceptably low in Model 4 ($p > 0.9$).
The second adjustment is to insert a variable for duration\footnote{
    Duration is a categorical variable which was important in both Models 1 and 2.
    As a categorical variable, it was decomposed into a boolean series for factor analysis.
    Models 1 and 2 retained one or more duration boolean factors, but none overlapped.
    As a result, duration was dropped from Models 3 and 4.
}.
% The duration factor which indicates that the respondent believes it takes more than a year to obtain an alternative credential
The belief that it takes more than a year to obtain an alternative credential
is positively correlated with hirability ($\beta = 0.875, p < 0.01$).

The preferred model is able to explain roughly one third of the variance in hirability.
Rulebreaker effects are significant invariant to specification.
Six of the seven perceived skill gaps in the preferred model are measures of soft skill.
The coefficient for the perceived technical skill gap is insignificant, but it does possess an intuitive negative sign which is robust to specification.
The dominant effect of soft skills in the preferred regression supports the main hypothesis.

In the classic signalling explanation of low ACNG demand, the ACNG signals an abnormal lack of concientiousness and conformity.
Regression analysis raises three problems for the conformity component of the classic explanation.
These problems are robust to the specification and operationalization of conformity.
First, rulebreaker effects are positively related to hirability.
Secondly, a gap in perceived nonconformity skill yields a negative coefficient on hirability.
This gap effect is equivalent to an association of low hirability and high conformity.

% TODO: this paragraph may not be needed in short paper.
% The gap effect applies to multiple models, but reference to a single model facilitates further explanation.
% Focusing on the preferred model facilitates further explanation.
Overqualification is ignored in Model 5, so a gap indicates that the job candidate has a low level of skill compared to an ideal candidate.
In this model, an increase to gap size is equal to a reduction in the perceived level of skill possessed by a job candidate.
The negative coefficient for nonconformity therefore indicates that a reduction to nonconformity is associated with reduced hirability.
Similarly, an increase to the level of perceived nonconformity shrinks the gap size and produces a positive change in hirability.
% Similarly, an increase to the level of perceived nonconformity shrinks the gap size and produces a reduced negative effect on hirability.
The positive relation between nonconformity and hirability is reinforced by a summary statistic,
which is that the average actual employee is perceived to have a higher level of nonconformity than both the ACNG and the recent college graduate.

The third reason that an ACNG nonconformity signal does not explain reduced hirability is that the ACNG and recent college graduate do not significantly differ in perceived levels of conformity.
This is presently demonstrated using summary statistics, but Table \ref{tab:gap_of_gaps} also provides regression analysis for comparative skill gaps.
% and is discussed in detail later in this paper.
% tab rulebreaker_ngwac rulebreaker_recentcollege, chi2
% sum rulebreaker_ideal rulebreaker_ngwac rulebreaker_recentcollegegraduat rulebreaker_typicalemployeeatmyc
% anova rulebreaker_ngwac rulebreaker_recentcollege
% reg rulebreaker_ngwac rulebreaker_recentcollege
The average level of perceived nonconformity for the ACNG is 6.43 with a standard deviation of 2.25.
The average for a recent college graduate is 6.29 with a standard deviation of 2.36.
Informally, a lack of significant difference is apparant in that the means differ by less than one quarter of a standard deviation.
Formally, the F-statistic from an analysis of variance ($F = 19.25$) and Pearson's chi-squared test ($\chi = 298.80$) both indicate a probability of independence which is less than 0.0001.

The coefficient on conscientiousness is significant and positive across specifications.
Intuition would dictate that a large gap in conscientiousness would be associated with reduced hirability.
Regression of the perceived gap in conscientiousness alone on hirability does produce the expected negative coefficient.
% There are two reasons for the sign change on conscientiousness in the multiple regression.
% The first explanation is bliss point seeking and the second is an explanation from attenuation.
%
% TODO: long paper food...replace below and above bliss seeking convo with marginal analysis and uncomment
% % As previously discussed, excess individual concientiousness can disturb team performance\cite{curcseu2019personality}.
% % It follows that there is some bliss point level of concientiousness.
% As previously discussed, external research indicates a bliss point for concientiousness.
% As a result, the sign of the coefficient on concientiousness is sensitive to the position of the model constant relative to the bliss point.
% % If the model constant is above the bliss point, concientiousness is expected to be positively signed.
% % The sample data is consistent with this explanation from bliss point seeking.
% In a simple regression of conscientiousness on hirability, the model constant is about $7.5$, and the coefficient on conscientiousness is negative.
% In the multiple regression, the model constant is near $0.5$, and the coefficient on conscientiousness is positive.
% The sample data is consistent with an explanation from bliss point seeking where the bliss point value is between 0.5 and 7.5.
% % TODO: long paper food...replace bliss seeking convo with marginal analysis and uncomment
% % TODO: reconcile bliss point seeking w fact that `sum concientiousness_ideal' yields ($\mu = 8.1, \sigma = 1.65$)...
% % ...>i think it's meanseeking not bliss seeking...
% % - 0.5 < y < 7.5 is an output constraint; independent effect is meanseeking not bliss seeking; bliss point would be 0 by construction
% % - meanseeking implies marginal effects; otherwise perfect meanseeking would be insignicance of the factor
% % - we can replace bliss point seeking analysis with marginal (decreasing return in either direction) but then it's like hey lazy analyst why not do all the marginal analysis?
%
% Adding a quadratic term to Model 5 identifies a negative marginal relation between conscientiousness and teamwork skill.
% This replicates the other research which found a parabolic relationship between peer-rated team contribution and conscientiousness.
% In addition, conscientiousness exhibits a negative marginal relation with hirability overall.
%
% The second explanation is that the direct measure of conscientiousness is an attenuating effect within certain specifications.
The explanation for the sign change is that the direct measure of conscientiousness is an attenuating effect within certain specifications.
% The explanation for the sign change during specification change is that the direct measure of conscientiousness is an attenuating effect within certain specifications.
% The second explanation is that the direct measure of conscientiousness is an attenuating effect in the context of particular model specifications.
% The second explanation is that the direct measure of conscientiousness is an attenuating effect in particular specifications. % an overstatement of the conscientiousness effect in the multiple regression.
Conscientiousness is cross-correlated with several factors in all models from Table \ref{tab:table_new_ols}.
% Conscientiousness also structurally interacts with rulebreaker effects.
% In theory, a person that is high in concientiousness will tend not to break rules.
%
% coefficient basically positive by coincidence, then...
% in other words, I'm hypothesizing negative embedded concientiousness effects in the cross-correlated factors.
% It could be the case that conscientiousness is a composite of positive and negative variation.
% It could be the case that these cross-correlates partial out a substantial degree of the negative variation in concientiousness,
% leaving net positive variation in the direct measure of conscientiousness.
% This hypothesis is tested by removing other skill gap factors and the rulebreaker effects from Model 5.

% leaving net positive variation in the direct measure of conscientiousness.

% This explanation is tested by removing other skill gap factors and the rulebreaker effects from Model 5.
This hypothesis is tested by removing other skill gap factors and the rulebreaker effects from Model 5.
The other factors for state, industry, duration, and employer status are retained.
When specified as such, the factor for the perceived concientiousness skill gap yields the expected negative coefficient ($\beta = -0.084, p < 0.31$).

Employer size is an important factor in the preferred model.
The largest category of employer is positively associated with hirability.
This finding supports the explanation of hirability from risk aversion over positive conformity selection.
% The largest category of employer has lower risk, and in fact generates comparative advantage, when hiring from a high-variance pool of candidate quality.

% TODO: long paper food...check state and industry effects against a regulation index
Some state and industrial effects are identified.
No particular relation among state effects was found, but further comparative policy research is encouraged.
With respect to industry, an interesting interaction between body language skill and employment in the information technology industry yields a positive coefficient.
Body language skill gaps on their are associated with reduced hirability.
The interaction indicates a reduced penalty for a lack of body language communication skill
% for job candidates
in the information technology industry.
With less confidence and more generality, the interaction indicates a reduced penalty for generalized soft skill deficiency in the information technology industry.
% With less strength and more breadth, a positive coefficient to the interaction variable indicates a reduced penalty for generalized soft skill deficiency in the information technology industry.

A reduced penalty for soft skill deficit helps explain the particular flourishing of alternative credentials in the information technology industry.
The reduced penalty in this particular industry might be related to a relative lack of deregulation in the industry.
Another explanation is that the reduced penalty may be related to cultural norms in the industry.
% Alternatively, it might be related to cultural norms around the acceptability of an anti-social geek in a technology field.
% The cultural norm itself might be derived from deeper collective personality organization.
There is less technical need for social skill in programming, so introverts may obtain a comparative advantage in this field.
These effects are not confirmed in the current study.
Further study which includes job candidate personality data could test this hypothesis.
% Because they are second, third, and further orders of effect, detecting such effects would require a larger sample.

\subsection{Explanatory Share of Perceived Gaps}

The preferred model explains about one third of hirability variance, but how much of the explanatory power is attributable to perceived skill gaps?
Table \ref{tab:explantory_power} provides evidence on the importance of perceived skill gaps and rulebreaker effects relative to other factor groups.
% This table compares the explanatory power of selected factor groups.
Industry and state effects are factor groups that are widely regarded in the external literature as important for models in the labor market.
Table \ref{tab:explantory_power} shows that perceived skill gaps and rulebreaker effects explain more variance in hirability than do the widely utilized variables for industry and state.
% are more than the widely accepted factors of importance when explaining hirability.
Rulebreaker effects collectively explain more than three times as much response variance as do industrial or state effects.

A comparison of simple regressions of perceived skill gaps on hirability reproduces the finding from multiple regression analysis that overqualification effects reduce explanatory power.
% Comparison of simple regressions of perceived skill gaps on reproduces the finding from multiple regression analysis that embedded overqualification effects reduce explanatory power.
Overqualification effects are heterogenously signed and curved by skill, so nonlinear analysis where the overqualification effects are isolated in distinct factors is likely to improve explanatory power.
Such analysis would also require a larger sample in order to compensate for the loss of degrees of freedom.

Semi-robust state effects are state effects which are significant in any multiple regression described in Table \ref{tab:table_new_ols}.
Robust state effects are the significant factors in a simple regression of semi-robust state effects on hirability.
Illinois is an example of a state effect that appears in models 1 and 2 from Table \ref{tab:table_new_ols} but is not significant in a simple regression of semi-robust state effects on hirability.

% TODO: long paper food...figure out how to explain this false positive identification risk and get some more word count.
% Because semi-robust state effects are a combination of robust and sensitive state effects which are sensitive to specification and some that are not,
% Semi-robust state effects are the set of robust effects plus effects which are sensitive to specification,
% so there is a strictly greater chance of false positive factor identification compared to the set of robust state effects.
% The simple regression that uses semi-robust state effects has a better chance of overfitting sample data.
The r-squared associated with a simple regression of semi-robust state effects is greater than the r-squared associated with robust state effects.
Analysis has shown that perceived skill gaps that include overqualification effects are comparatively weak representations of perceived skill gaps for models of hirability.
A conservative lower-bound on the explanatory ratio of perceived skill gaps to state effects can be constructed by using these two measures.
Perceived skill gaps conservatively explain about 14 percent more variance in hirability than do state effects\footnote{
    This is computed as $(0.0737 / 0.0648) - 1 = .1373$ and rounded to 0.14.
}.

With overqualification, perceived skill gaps explain about fifty percent more of the variance in hirability compared to industry or robust state effects.
Without overqualification, the adjusted explanatory power of perceived skill gaps is about three times the adjusted explanatory power of industry or state effects.
Rulebreaker effects are about twice as important as perceived skill gaps.
% These results provide evidence that ACNG hirability depends importantly on the way a particular employer views nonconformists.
% indicates that the skill gap in willingness to break rules is highly sensitive to the particular employer
% TODO: long paper food...it also indicates we should be testing interaction variables but meh and sample size etc
% This is not taken to be a general lesson about skill gaps.
% Willingness to break rules is a special case of a behavior which is valuable under certain parameters.
% This contrasts with something like poor communication skill which is generally detrimental.
These findings collectively provide evidence that perceived skill gaps and rulebreaker effects are factors of high importance for models of hirability.

\subsection{Perceived Gaps Compared to the Recent College Graduate}

Table \ref{tab:gap_of_gaps} provides two models of hirability where comparative skill gaps are the independent factors.
Model 6 is an adjustment of Model 5, where perceived skill gaps are transformed into comparative skill gaps and all other factors are dropped.
Model 7 is derived from Model 6 by consolidating factors in order to maximize adjusted explanatory power.
The four factors that were eliminated in the consolidation from Model 6 to Model 7 had a p-value greater than 0.55.
% Because the p-value is greater than 0.5, these coefficients can be interpreted as more likely not to represent a real relation than to represent a real relation.
% This indicates all four eliminated factors were more likely not to have a relation than to have a relation.
% Model 7 is the preferred comparative gap model.
The maximum p-value in Model 7 is less than 0.16.

Models 6 and 7 demonstrate that a few soft skills do constitute a significant difference between groups.
The main differentiator between ACNG labor and the recent college graduate is body language communication skill.
% Recent college graduates are perceived as skilled in this area,
ACNG labor is perceived as comparatively deficient in this skill,
and the comparative deficiency is associated with reduced ACNG hirability.

Concientiousness and willingness to commute are the other two comparative skill gaps in Model 7.
These two factors are positively signed, smaller in magnitude, and lower in significance when compared to the factor for body language communication skill.
Model 7 plus summary statistics on the average value for each independent variable demonstrates that
the average total effect of comparative skill gaps on hireability is negative\footnote{
    % per analysis-7-diff-of-gaps.do
    The respective mean values for the comparative gaps in perceived body language skill,
    willingness to commute,
    and conscientiousness
    are -0.1415, 0.0943, and 0.0330.
    The average total effect on hireability attributable to these effects is computed as:
    % $Y = -0.3395*0.1415 - 0.1575*0.0943 + 0.1508*0.0330 = -0.0579$.
    $-0.0579 = -0.3395*0.1415 - 0.1574*0.0943 + 0.1508*0.0330$.
}.
This replicates external research which shows lower demand for ACNG labor.

%       this is to say that ACNG overqualified vis a vis skill is not the same as overqualified vis a vis ideal
%       they are fundamentally different kinds of overqualification and should not be intermingled
%       the statistical effect is that the minimum value of (acng - recent grad) skill is higher than it otherwise would be
%       this pushes up the average value in turn.
%       meh not super convincing bc it would push coefficient towards zero but not flip the sign...i think that could be wrong tho...
% %
% % or the positive B on willingness to commute for that matter
% % The positive coefficient on the factors for comparative perceived skill in concientiousness and willingness to commute
% The positive coefficients on factors of concientiousness and willingness to commute are unexpected.

% The findings of this study on comparative conscientiousness neither refute nor support the conscientiousness component of the classic signalling explanation.
% Model 7 identifies three comparative gaps as important in a multiple regression on hirability.
% Concientiousness is one of those gaps, and it possessess an unexpected positive coefficient.
% The positive comparative gap coefficient indicates that an ACNG candidate with a large perceived skill deficit is hirable compared to a recent college graduate with a small perceived deficit in concientiousness.
% This result is unexpected, and it is also reminiscent of the unexpected positive coefficient on the noncomparative perceived concientiousness factor in Model 5.

% % ref: reg fav diff_wno_concien
% The noncomparative perceived concientiousness factor in Model 5 was explained using bliss point seeking and attenuation.
% In the case of this comparative gap, the explanation from attenuation fails.
% The factor for the comparative perceived concientiousness skill gap retains a positive coefficient in a simple regression on hirability, although the coefficient is also insignificant ($p > 0.55$).
% % A simple regression of the  on hirability retains a positive coefficient.
% % The coefficient in the simple regression, however, is statistically insignificant ($p > 0.55$).
% % Significance is likely to improve with further sampling. Further sampling might also entirely eliminate the identification of a positive comparative coefficient.

% Concientiousness is identified with some significance as a comparative skill gap, but it favors the ACNG in hirability.
% This appears at first to be a case similar to the counterintuitve result found in Model 5.
% Further analysis shows critical differences between the comparative gap specification and Model 5.
% When the comparative gap factor for concientiousness is regressed alone on hirability, the positive coefficient persists.
% The coefficient is also insignificant.
% As such, the explanation from attenuation fails for the comparative gap in concientiousness.
% Secondly, it is not obvious whether there should be any bliss point value for the comparative gap.
% % this would probably get sorted out with a larger sample size and/or nonlinear analysis

Model 7 also provides a skill-level diagnostic in service of closing the demand gap.
This model indicates that the soft skill of communication through body language is the only skill difference associated with reduced hireability.
It is also the most significant and largest in magnitude of such differences.
This result should not be interpreted as a hireability difference due to generalized communication skill.
Perceived skill gaps for verbal and written communication are insignificant.

\section{Conclusion}

% TODO: long paper food...talk about job candidate stigma mitigation techniques and hope for the ACNG
%       ACNG is not strictly dispreferred to the college grad, they just need to find a well-fitting employer

This study provides evidence that skill signals are an important factor of hirability and are unique for the ACNG.
Perceived skill gaps do a better job of explaining hirability than do other widely recognized effects including industry and state effects.
Employer factors better explain candidate hirability than do the perceived skill gaps themselves.
Technical skill gaps were identified with less relevance to the hiring decision when compared with soft skill gaps for the ACNG job candidate.

This paper provides evidence that some employers engage in conformity selection as a means of avoiding risk to the reputation, productivity, or value of a company.
% Conformity selection of this kind, however, is only a proximal explanation.
An explanation from risk aversion fully this kind of conformity selection and also explains other behavior.
Respondents were most favorable to the description of nonconformists as individuals that could just as easily be high performers as low performers.
Aversion to this kind of labor is better explained as risk aversion rather than positive selection for conformity.

Risk aversion and conformity selection are both partially unconcious biases which lead to suboptimal organizational operation.
A practical recommendation is for organizations to implement bias controls with respect to ACNG evaluation.
An example control would be to provide human resource procedures for formal evaluation of particular credentials which are relevant to specified job families.
These procedures can be immediately executed among known credentials and job families.
% Adjustments can be applied to new hires or during performance reviews for current employees.
These procedures should be retained for ongoing application as new credentials are developed and encountered over time.

Some evidence on the role of misinformation is demonstrated in a survey on trade schooling taken in 2019\cite{arabia_2019}.
Only 27 percent of respondents correctly responded that lower debt is an advantage of enrolling in trade school relative to college.
Additionally, over 75 percent of respondents failed to notice that trade school graduates receive industry employment sooner
and receive specialized training when compared to a four-year college.
% The news that employers are generally favorable to alternative credentials should be shared far and wide.
% The current education system should be reformed to better inform students about non-college career entry.
Obtaining a college degree after obtaining some work experience will allow students to leverage employer tuition benefits.
Because ACNG hirability varies importantly by particular employer, ACNG job candidates are advised to apply to a substantial number of employers at the outset of the job search.
Insight into ACNG hirability at a particular firm can be obtained prior to application through social networking with employees of the firm,
online research into the policies of the target employer,
or consulting a recruiter that specializes in the target employment industry.
% Government should emphasize job skills over the formal degree.
% Recent moves have begun such emphasis\cite{https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/26/trump-executive-order-stresses-skill-over-college-degree-hiring/3263074001/}

% Out of scope for this paper, but important:
% 1. aggregate social, legal, political, and economic movements (aggregate study is wanting, we know states, time, industry all matter)
% 2. applicant personal effects, and interviewer-applicant interaction effects
% despite those caveats, we can reasonably explain employer hirability their imagined candidate based on matching effects

% Studying skill gaps provides an explanation with several gaps.
The preferred model explains about one third of hirability.
Perceived skill gaps and rulebreaker effects account for most of the explanatory power in the model.
The explanatory power of this study can be meaningfully improved in a few ways.
% This study uses a cross-sectional analysis to investigate a subject that varies over time.
% The traditional system of accredited undergraduate education was itself at one time an innovation.
% Abnormal job candidates differentiated themselves using novel credentials, and broad employer adoption was achieved over time.
% This paper suggests that the alternative credentials of today will follow a similar pattern.
% also, role, firm, and industry-level supply, demand, employment, and so on...
% Dynamic analysis would improve on the cross-sectional analysis in this paper.
Longitudinal study would allow for causal analysis and improve forecasting of ACNG hirability in the future.
Other research has conducted some dynamic analysis of the same dependent variable with different regressors\cite{vandivier2020preliminary}.
Integrated analysis would be useful for replication and the generation of new models of better explanatory power.
Analysis that includes overqualification effects and heterogeneous nonlinear relations between skill gaps and hirability would improve estimates of hirability for a candidate of a particular skill profile.

% TODO: this paragraph not needed in short paper
This paper noted that large employers and the information technology industry has a peculiar suceptibility to alternative credentials,
so recent changes implemented by Google may be indicative of future trends.
Google has not required a college degree since prior to 2013\cite{bryant2013head}.
Laszlo Bock, then Senior Vice President of People Operations at Google, stated the following in 2013:
"After two or three years, your ability to perform at Google is completely unrelated to how you performed when you were in school, because the skills you required in college are very different."
In 2020, Google added three new certificate programs to an existing set and declared that all of its certificates would be treated as the equivalent of an undergraduate degree for their hiring purposes\cite{hess_2020}.

If perceived skill is representative of actual skill,
then the current study concludes that employers should be more willing to hire an ACNG.
At the same time, this paper provides evidence that perceived and actual skill levels sometimes do not align.
For example, the average recent college graduate in the sample is perceived to have better technical skill compared to the average ACNG.
This is surprising because last mile training, a kind of alternative education, has been specifically recommended in popular literature as a remedy for the technical skill gaps that exist among recent college graduates.
% Further study of the differences between perceived and actual skill would be valuable.

Employers seem to be favorable to individuals with alternative credentials.
In many cases, employer-perceived skill gaps are not statistically different when comparing recent college gradutes with ACNG candidates.
Social preference for the college degree may be better explained by public ignorance about appropriate alternative programs,
a lack of appropriate programs for certain occupations,
and government financial and other policy which gives preference to accredited education.

% Notice that the alternatively credentialed individual doesn't need the average employer to value him or her.
% He or she simply needs some significant chance of being hired, and that certainly exists.
% Moreover, the average employer is already favorable to alternative credentials.
% As more alternatively credentialed individuals are highered and promoted through society,
% there is reason to think the number of opportunities afforded to alternatively educated individuals may grow.
% The problem doesn't seem to be about whether alternative credentials work, but whether they exist in a given industrial context,
% and whether an individual would like to pay the college premium for better hirability when both options are feasible.
