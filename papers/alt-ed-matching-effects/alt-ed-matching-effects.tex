        % Employer attitudes are not meaningfully different from the general public.
        % Support is found for soft-skill bias
        % further support to soft-skill bias, or relative technical favor for alternative education, is the finding that skill gaps importantly vary by industry, esp IT.

        This paper explores an original data set
        to understand the influence of perceived skill gaps on hiring.
        Results show that employers expect low skill from non-college graduates.
        This result holds for technically certified individuals.
        Respondents expect non-college graduates to break formal and informal rules.
        Interestingly, this is considered a valuable behavior.
        State and industry effects explain about 5 percent of outcomes, skill gaps explain about 10 percent, and interviewer perspectives on rulebreakers explain about 15 percent.
        Perceived soft skill gaps are particularly important.

\section{Introduction}

A substantial gap exists between the skills expected by employers and those possessed by college graduates\cite{mcgarry2016examination, malik2017great, abbasi2018analysis, gingras2000there}.
Experts view vocational school and alternative postsecondary education as effective for technical training, but the traditional degree remains associated with higher wages.
This paper tests the hypothesis that perceived skill gaps explain the salary variance.
In particular, this paper hypothesizes a perceived soft skills gap among non-college graduates.
% This paper proposes skill gaps are perceived in particular among soft skills for alternatively educated individuals.
% one might argue employers are mistaken here; technical work may involve higher, not lower, conscientiousness; ya maybe but out of scope.
% that is, we test social stigma and skill-level / decomposed stigma; an application of the signlaing model.

% Sustained rising costs to higher education motivate periodic review of the return to the degree.
% Despite rising costs, Americans have become more educated than expected over the past decade.
% Trades have contemporaneously seen a labor shortage.

% actually, trade school enrollment is increasing faster than undergraduate enrollment
% https://www.chronicle.com/newsletter/the-edge/2020-01-22
% By 2020, They Said, 2 Out of 3 Jobs Would Need More Than a High-School Diploma. Were They Right?
% overinvestment in college seems to cause a technical labor shortage, but the market is compensating by enrolling more technical folks too
% https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/03/choosing-trade-school-over-college/584275/
% undergraduate enrollment has slowed recently and many employers have dropped the degree requirement
% https://www.npr.org/2019/12/16/787909495/fewer-students-are-going-to-college-heres-why-that-matters
% it is not the case that employers are increasingly demanding the degree, but it is the case that many do today. Let's examine their reasons.
% peak college?

% Faster and cheaper alternatives to college exist, but high schools prefer immediate college enrollment over alternative options at a rate of nearly 2:1.
% A New U: Faster + Cheaper Alternatives to College

% Faster and cheaper alternatives to college exist, but the typical student prefers to immediately enroll in college.
% Five student-oriented explanations include an inflated perception of the return to college,
% lack of awareness about alternative programs,
% social pressure to pursue college over alternatives,
% inability to confidently compare returns to alternatives,
% and risk aversion which favors college as a low-risk option despite high cost.

% students overestimate wage gap and employability gap college v technical school
% https://www.bigrentz.com/blog/trade-school-survey
% https://www.manufacturing.net/labor/news/13250675/survey-majority-of-students-underestimate-trade-school

% An undergraduate degree is a historically reputable investment.
The signaling model has become a standard explanation of the value of the degree.
Following this model, scholars claim that the college degree signals intelligence, work ethic, and conformity\cite{caplan2018case}.
Alternative credentials do not signal work ethic or conformity, but they do indicate intelligence and technical skill.
This paper tests the hypothesis that employers assume a deficit in the differential properties of conformity and conscientiousness.

% Proponents of the signaling model often prefer employer-oriented explanations of college enrollment.
% In this explanation, employers prefer college graduates because the degree signals intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity.
% While a technical credential signals intelligence and technical skill, the absence of a degree yields a perceived gap in the mind of the employer.
% There is a perceived comparative lack on the part of the non-college graduate with respect to conscientiousness and conformity.
% This paper tests this hypothesis.

% An agent-based explanation would be that high school graduates are not taught about these alternatives.
% The college degree is popular, has a well-defined return, and is low in risk.
% Particular alternative programs are obscure and often lack a well-defined return.

Conscientiousness is associated with a variety of positive outcomes,
but there is reason for employers to value imperfect conformity.
% The conformity explanation has a logical problem in that efficient firms must continually innovate.
Firm innovation is attributable to underlying employee innovation, but conformity is antithetical to innovation.
Leaders and high performers also behave abnormally, but in a way that is seen as desirable.
% Leadership and high performance are two other qualities which are both valuable and nonconformist.
% In short, markets have reason to demand nonconformity in at least some firms and occupations.

Risk aversion represents a seperate reason to select for conformity.
A risk averse employer with low ability to distinguish high performing outliers from low performing outliers may prefer not to hire an outlier at all.
The gamble is particularly expensive for small employers that are unable to spread risk across many hires.
A secondary investigation in this paper will be to look for employer size effects.
If large employers are favorable to alternatively educated individuals, this will add weight to an explanation based on risk aversion.

% An alternative explanation to general confromity value, then, is risk aversion.
% Employers will still prefer a traditionally educated job candidate if the employer is risk averse.
% Unconventional candidates have a greater chance of being outlier performers, on both the low and high sides of a distribution.
% Risk averse employers will tend to take a conventionally educated individual and avoid the gamble.
% The highest performing employers, however, will be able to distinguish desirable from undesirable candidates within the unconventional pool.
% Some employers will also simply be relatively risk-tolerant.
% Finally, some employers will value nonconformity signals to such an extant that risk is outweighed.

% % a missing link for future research: favorability only correlates with actual hiring decisions it isn't a hiring decision
% Hiring decisions reflect boundedly rational demand for skilled labor.
% The college degree and alternative credentials provide two qualitatively distinct signals of skilled labor.
% The hireability of individuals in possession of these credentials has been studied,
% but the underlying determinants are not clear.
% This paper hypothesizes that perceived skill gaps are important determinants of willingness to hire.
% This paper further hypothesizes that perceived skill gaps are qualitatively different between college graduates and others.
% % In particular, this paper hypothesizes that a noncollege stigma is obtained for candidates without a degree in pursuit of roles typically filled by degree holders.
% % soft skill bias in particular

Alternative credentials refer to credentials other than the undergraduate degree\cite{brown2017complex}.
The category includes, for example,
industry certifications,
portfolios of work,
and transcript, badges, or other records of unaccredited learning and achievement.
Individuals pursuing alternative credentials typically intend to leverage the credential toward better employment.
That is, they have the same ends as college students.
Many individuals obtain alternative credentials as a supplement to the degree.
Such a situation is pareto-superior to degree attainment alone and is therefore intentionally excluded from analysis.
This paper focuses on alternatively credentialed non-college graduates in order to better identify stigmata of interest.
% Alternative credentials can be obtained quickly and cheaply relative to college.
% Obtaining a college degree signals intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity,
% but it may not signal technical skill\cite{horton_2020}.
% Alternative credentials signal technical skill.
% As such, they provide an effective supplement to the degree.

% This paper is concerned with another use case in which the degree is entirely substituted.
% In that situation, employers may apply a noncollege stigma.
% This is particularly the case for roles which are typically occupied by degree holders.
% Noncollege stigma is a presumption, expectation, or bias toward perception of a skill gap of a certain kind.
% Whether the gap exists in fact is out of the scope of the present paper.

% Technical skill generally implies intelligence.
% Alternative credentials, then, fail to signal two qualities compared to the degree.
% Alternative credentials fail to signal conscientiousness and conformity.
% Interestingly, some employers may demand some level of nonconformity.
% Employers may also presume a certain lack of soft skill on the part of highly technical applicants.
% % Finally, employers may use alternative credentials as a proxy for other employee characteristics like income, education, race, and gender.

% three interesting follow-on questions:
%   1. do employers have such a bias
%   2. is such a soft skills gap presumption actually true
%   3. if true, due employers overvalue the soft skills gap
% related paradox: most people won't be in a job for 4-5 years,
% so why do they need to show conscientiousness and conformity towards the 4-5 year bachelor's goal line?
% hard skill stigma: in my experience, people who are highly technical are hard to work with
% soft skill bias: I am favorable bc i think u have soft skills (and maybe this is efficient...enter eq/iq discussion)

% \subsection{Process Explanations of Suboptimal Wages}

% Basic price theory holds that an employer should pay wages equal to the marginal revenue product of labor.
% In the real world, measuring candidate productivity at hiring time is costly and imperfect.
% % This produces a technical error which assumes alignment between the goals of the firm and a hiring team.
% A further issue is identified when the hiring team is scrutinized for principal-agent problems.
% The hiring team is composed of individuals with preferences, calculative limitations, and other biases.
% Monitoring and correcting for these problems is expensive,
% so firms will heterogenously realize some aggregation of these individual definiciencies.

% Exacerbating the already necessarily imperfect hiring process are candidate-side problems.
% Firms must hire among a finite, potentially small, number of candidates.
% Risk aversion to time expense and other search costs may lead a firm to approve a suboptimal candidate\cite{simon1976substantive}.
% In some cases, candidate pools may be systematically problematic.
% In law and medicine, for example, extensive education and training are legally required.
% These policies further restrict the candidate pool, inflate expected wages, and systematically alter the content of education in a politically-motivated manner.
% Market forces implement hiring as a lumpy expenditure process to begin with, but certification requirements, wage regulation, and other policies extend the problem.

% The prior discussion highlights many locations of hiring process inefficiency.
% The practical importance of magnitudes and kinds of such effects are described in a legion of related papers.
% A meager sampling of five such effects would include the attractiveness effect and many other issues related to gender bias\cite{quereshi1986physical},
% agentic behavioral stigma\cite{steffens2009feminization},
% and complex biases related to communication style\cite{brouer2017gender, nijs2019effects, sampugnaro1983nonverbal}.
% Sung et al find that impression management meaningfully weakens disability stigma\cite{sung2017disclose}.
% These tactics are transferable in part to noncollege stigma mitigation.
% Finally, there are a wealth of concerns about the effects of social media.
% For one, it presents a channel for the revival of religious discrimination\cite{esposito2018signaling}.

% In the face of so many important inefficiencies, one begins to wonder whether the original theory holds any water at all.
% Papers which identify matching effects, including the present paper,
% serve to limit the proportion of explanation attributable to bias and redeem the elementary price theory story to some extent.
% Prior work demonstrates the important of matching effects in the form of norm compliance\cite{francesco1981gender}.
% Meta-accuracy is a kind of matching measure, and it has been shown to move positively with hireability\cite{renier2018no}.

\section{Methodology}

% Responses were submitted using the SurveyMonkey web application.
This study uses ordinary least squares regression analysis to estimate the effect of perceived skill gaps on willingness to hire.
Perceived skill gaps and willingness to hire are included in original response data collected by online survey ($n = 212$).
Observations are cross-sectional and taken at the individual level.
The data is available for replication or any other use\footnote{
    See \url{https://osf.io/8qtxf/?view_only=95b0c0b0c65e4b7983198cc87c2ab733}
    for data used in this study.
}.

Respondents were obtained through the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service.
Respondents were United States citizens at or over the age of eighteen.
Respondents were paid for participation.
The survey administration took place in July of 2020.

Respondents were asked 65 questions in two sections.
The first section of responses describe the respondent.
There are 13 questions in this section.
The second section identifies perceived skill gaps for 13 skills.
Each section beings with a contextual message to normalize response anchoring.
Questions are provided in nonrandom order for the same reason.
Appendix A provides a copy of the survey.

% TODO: should we give more description to section 1 questions? do we need to go through each factor...?
% for now I punt this to results section, so I only actually describe factors that have a substantial result.
% The dependent variable of interest is favorability to the hiring of an alternatively educated non-college graduate.
% missing industrial variables: hospitality (restaurant/hotels) and entertainment / media, and sales!

Data from the second section is used to calculate perceived skill gaps.
For each of 13 skills, the respondent is asked to imagine four types of candidates.
One type of candidate is an ideal candidate.
At a high level, skill gaps are calculated by differencing skill levels of the ideal candidate with others.

Perceived skill is reported on a scale from 1 to 10.
Perceived skill is reported for the ideal candidate,
the average actual employee,
the average recent college graduate,
and the average alternatively credentialed non-college graduate.
Skill gaps are technically computed in two ways.
One method allows for overqualification of job candidates and the other does not.
Overqualification effects have been identified as important\cite{green2007there, raybould2005over}, but these effects are often ignored during skill gap analysis\cite{blake_2018}.

When overqualification is allowed, the skill gap is measured as a raw skill gap.
The raw skill gap is the skill level of the ideal candidate less the skill level of the actual candidate.
The skill gap without overqualification is calculated as the raw skill gap or zero if the raw skill gap value is negative.

% my prior work has shown that we can predict (r2 0.5 - 0.7 and ar2 0.3 - 0.6) alternative education favorability from employer factors alone - without concern to matching

\section{Results}

% This paper acknowledges that own analysis proceeds through a technocentric lens.
% This is an important anchoring point for the analysis, and it may skew application of results in low-technology or low-skill sectors.
% The technocentric lens is an important caveat and anchoring point, but I argue that it is about as proper as any anchoring point.
% In economics, after all, technology operationalizes the theory of innovation per se.
% All skills can be viewed as point-in-time innovations, so that if there was no innovation then neither would there be a need for any skill.
% By the same token, a technocentric lens at the present seems close to a cross-industry lens at a future time.
% Anchoring to any other industry would be both asymmetric and unusuful in the future.
% Perhaps this analysis is slightly skewed, but at least it is skewed only against the past, and will be increasingly useful in the future without partiality to any particular industry.
% In addition, we did check for industrial effects, but the analytical skew may persist pass the data.

% This orientation occurs because New Alternative Education first flourished for roles in the information technology sector, and only later did roles like sales, business, art, nursing, and more join in.

% Compare directly to bootcamp results from Indeed: https://www.indeed.com/lead/what-employers-think-about-coding-bootcamp

Alternatively credentialed non-college graduate (ACNG) hireability was generally positive.
The mean response was 7.5 on a scale from one to ten ($\sigma = 1.80$).
Employers status was not associated with a significant response effect.
Perceived skill gaps explained a significant and important portion of hireability variance.

Table \ref{tab:explantory_power} compares perceived skill gap explanatory power in a simple regression
to explanatory power of other simple regressions involving factors of known relevance to hireability.
Allowing for overqualification seems to weaken explanatory power.
Overqualification effects seem to be heterogeneously signed per skill, so generalizing weakens overall explanatory power relative to ignoring these effects.
With overqualification, perceived skill gaps explain about fifty percent more than industrial effects or robust state effects.
Without overqualification, the adjusted explanatory power of perceived skill gaps is about three times the adjusted explanatory power of industry or state effects.
Semi-robust state factors are dummy variables by state which are significant in a multiple regression.
Robust state factors are subset of semi-robust state factors which are additionally significant in a simple regression.

Table \ref{tab:explantory_power} also describes the explanatory power of so-called rulebreaker effects.
Whether the candidate is perceived as a rule breaker is a perceived skill gap, but employers evaluate this gap in a heterogenous and multispecific way.
In the first place, this heterogenous evaluation has sign and magnitude implications for the dependent variable of interest.
Secondarily, heterogenous evaluation implies a qualitatively different evaluation.
These differences are captured using three questions in the first section of the survey.

\end{table}

The three rulebreaker questions measure respondent agreement on a scale from 1 to 10 with statements about rulebreakers, or "People who are willing to break formal or informal rules and norms."
The first statement indicates that rulebreakers present a risk to the reputation, productivity, or value of a company.
This statement received the least agreement and greatest response variance among three qualitatively different descriptions of people that are willing to break rules ($\mu = 6.40, \sigma = 2.55$).

The second statement states that people break rules which hold them back, and that rulebreakers "could just as easily be high performers as low performers."
This statement received the most agreement and least comparative response variance as a rule breaker description ($\mu = 7.42, \sigma = 1.91$).
The agreement with this statement provides evidence against the thesis that employers value conformity for its own sake.
In turn, this adds weight to the theory that employers value conformity as a risk aversion tactic, but they actually believe nonconformity may signal positive outlier potential.
The third description of rulebreakers states that they tend to be gifted in the areas of innovation or creativity, and that such people may benefit the company of a culture ($\mu = 7.25, \sigma = 2.03$).

Each of the three rulebreaker effects turns out to be independently important.
These effects collectively explain more than three times as much response variance as do industrial or state effects.
Rulebreaker effects are about twice as important as perceived skill gaps.
This is not taken to be a general lesson about skill gaps.
Willingness to break rules is a special case of a behavior which is valuable under certain parameters.
This contrasts with something like poor communication skill which is generally detrimental.

Table \ref{tab:table_new_ols} reports selected factor statistics across five least squares multiple regressions.
The selected factors which are reported include any perceived skill gap which is important in any specification.
Factor importance is determined by the ability of a factor to improve model adjusted explanatory power.
Model 1 is a multiple regression using skill gaps that allow for overqualification.
Model 2 is a multiple regression without overqualification.

Models 3 and 4 are equivalent to models 1 and 2, respectively, after normalizing for certain effects.
Industry, state, and company size effects are the specific effects which are normalized.
These effects are normalized for robustness by cross-referencing the subfactors from models 1 and 2.
Robust effects are retained.
For example, some state effects are important in one specification and not in the other.
Such state effects are dropped in Models 3 and 4.

Model 5 is specified as Model 4 plus two adjustments.
First, the factor for salary is dropped.
The salary factor improved adjusted explanatory power in Model 2, but it provided no such benefit in any other model.
Moreover, the p-value of this factor was unacceptably low in Model 4 ($p > 0.9$).
The second adjustment is to add a duration factor.

The duration factor is a measure of the length of time a respondent believes it takes to earn an alternative credential.
Duration is a categorical variable which was important in both Models 1 and 2.
As a categorical variable, it was decomposed into a boolean series for factor analysis.
Models 1 and 2 retained one or more duration dummies, but none overlapped.
As a result, duration was dropped from Models 3 and 4.

After dropping the salary factor, duration was reanalyzed in the new multiple regressive context.
A single duration factor proved important in this reanalysis.
The duration factor which indicates that a respondent believes it takes more than a year to obtain an alternative credential
is significantly and importantly associated with improved willingness to hire ($\beta = 0.875, p < 0.01$).

An individual is considered an employer if they state that they contribute to hiring and firing decisions.
Employer effects are positively signed in all five models, but the significance is lost after normalizing effects.
This suggests that employer favorability to alternative credentials is sensitive to industry and state of residence.

The preferred model is able to explain roughly one third of the willingness to hire.
7 of 13 skill gaps investigated contribute to this model, and two stand out as the most significant.
Technical skill gaps are insignificant but they are robust across specifications and possess the expected negative sign.
Other than technical skill, the remaining gaps are soft skills.
Body language skill gaps and skill gaps in work ethic are the two most significant factors in this model.
The relative importance of soft skill gaps, and work ethic in particular, adds weight to a revision of the usual signalling explanation as the most plausible story.

An important and complicated finding involves conscientiousness.
Notice that the effect is robustly positive across specifications.
Simple intuition would indicate that a large conscientiousness gap is associated with improved hireability.
This is an oversimplification which results from linear analysis.

A simple regression of conscientiousness on favorability produces an expected negative sign.
That supports the intuitive notion that a lack of conscientiousness is associated with reduced hireability.
That result is also an oversimplification.
A synthesis of both results and outside research indicates there is some bliss point for work ethic.
The change in the model constant from the simple regression to the multiple regression explains the robust sign inversion.
In the multiple regression, the model constant is near $0.5$, while in the simple regression it is about $7.5$.

In one study, conscientiousness exhibited a parabolic relationship with peer-rated team contribution\cite{curcseu2019personality}.
Adding a quadratic term to Model 5 replicates a negative marginal relation between conscientiousness and teamwork skill.
In addition, conscientiousness exhibits a negative marginal relation with hireability overall.
% I don't do causal analysis of team dynamics on hireability but it's intuitive.

% much of the below could be heavily edited or deleted pending hanson's feedback.
Complementary to the bliss point explanation is an explanation from attenuation.
In the current data set, conscientiousness exhibits an important cross-correlation with several factors including willingness to commute and customer service skill.
Conscientiousness also structurally interacts with independent rulebreaker effects.
Theoretically, conscientiousness is related to rule breaking behavior, but the effect on hireability is interacted with employer perceptions of those who break rules.
Because these factors are entered independently in the multiple regression, the underlying component of conscientiousness is entered in redunantly.
Because conscientiousness gaps have a negative effect, the overall negative effect is overstated.
The direct factor of conscientiousness corrects, or attenuates, the the overstated effect which is partialled in, or captured in, the correlated independent factors.
Removal of other skill gap factors and rulebreaker factors from Model 5 validates this explanation by yielding a negative coefficient ($\beta = -0.084, p < 0.31$).

The importance of conscientiousness does not add weight to the classic signaling explanation.
The conscientiousness gap is not a comparative gap between a recent college graduate and a non-college graduate.
It is a gap between an ideal job candidate and an ACNG.
An important note is that the conscientiousness gap among recent college graduates is statitistically no different from an ACNG.
Unsurprisingly, the candidate perceived to have a minimal conscientiousness gap is the typical employee already working in the labor force.
A comparative gap of note would be that college graduates were perceived to have better technical skills compared to the average ACNG.

Employer size was an important factor in the preferred model.
The largest category of employer is positively associated with willingness to hire an ACNG.
This matches the risk aversion model.
The largest category of employer has lower risk, and in fact generates comparative advantage, when hiring from a high-variance pool of candidate quality.

Some state and industrial effects are identified.
No particular relation among state effects was found, but further comparative policy research is encouraged.
With respect to industry, an interesting interaction between body language skill and employment in the information technology is identified.
The interacted variable has a positive association with willingness to hire.
Body language skill gaps on their own are associated with reduced willingness to hire.
This specifically indicates a reduced penalty for lacking body language communication skills in the information technology industry.
With less strength and more breadth, a positive coefficient to the interaction variable indicates a reduced penalty for generalized soft skill deficiency in the information technology industry.

A reduced penalty for soft skill deficit helps explain the particular flourishing of alternative credentials in the information technology industry.
The reduced penalty in this particular industry might be related to a relative lack of deregulation in the industry.
Alternatively, it might be related to cultural norms around the acceptability of an anti-social geek in a technology field.
The cultural norm itself might be derived from deeper collective personality organization.
That is, there is less technical need for social skills in programming and related discplines, so introverts may naturally obtain a comparative advantage in this field.

\section{Conclusion}

This study demonstrates that perceived skill gap variance is qualitatively different for alternatively educated non-college graduates.
Perceived skill gaps do a better job of explaining willingness to hire than do other widely recognized effects including industry and state effects.
Employer factors better explain candidate hireability than do the perceived skill gaps themselves.
This paper finds multiple facts in support of employer risk aversion over conformity selection when considering job candidates that lack a college degree.
Technical skill gaps were identified with less relevance to the hiring decision when compared with soft skill gaps for the ACNG job candidate.

Some evidence on the role of misinformation is demonstrated in a survey on trade schooling taken in 2019\cite{arabia_2019}.
Only 27 percent of respondents correctly responded that lower debt is an advantage of enrolling in trade school relative to college.
Additionally, over 75 percent of respondents failed to notice that trade school graduates receive industry employment sooner
and receive specialized training when compared to a four-year college.
% The news that employers are generally favorable to alternative credentials should be shared far and wide.
% The current education system should be reformed to better inform students about non-college career entry.
Obtaining a college degree after obtaining some work experience will allow students to leverage employer tuition benefits.
% Government should emphasize job skills over the formal degree.
% Recent moves have begun such emphasis\cite{https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/26/trump-executive-order-stresses-skill-over-college-degree-hiring/3263074001/}

% Out of scope for this paper, but important:
% 1. aggregate social, legal, political, and economic movements (aggregate study is wanting, we know states, time, industry all matter)
% 2. applicant personal effects, and interviewer-applicant interaction effects
% despite those caveats, we can reasonably explain employer willingness to hire their imagined candidate based on matching effects

% Studying skill gaps provides an explanation with several gaps.
In addition to the noted applications of the results of this study, there are several ways in which results could be technically improved.
The preferred model explains about one third of willingness to hire.
This study uses a cross-sectional analysis to investigate a subject that varies over time.
The traditional system of accredited undergraduate education was itself at one time an innovation.
Abnormal job candidates differentiated themselves using novel credentials, and broad employer adoption was achieved over time.
This paper concludes that the alternative credentials of today will follow a similar pattern.
% also, role, firm, and industry-level supply, demand, employment, and so on...

Dynamic technical analysis would yield deeper understanding of such trends and achieve greater overall explanatory power.
Dynamic analysis would also generate better opportunity for causal understanding.
Other research has conducted some dynamic analysis of the same dependent variable
with differing independent inputs\cite{vandivier2020preliminary}.
Integrated modelling of those effects with skill gap analysis could replicate results and generate new models of better explanatory power.
Specifications that allow for overqualification effects and heterogeneous curved relations between skill gaps and hireability would improve not only the present paper,
but the state of the art in skill gap analysis.

If perceived skill is representative of actual skill,
then the current study concludes that employers should be more willing to hire alternatively educated non-college graduates.
At the same time, this paper demonstrates plausible misalignment of perceived and actual skill in some cases.
Last mile training is a type of alternative education which has been specifically recommended as a remedy for technical skill gaps among recent college graduates.
It is surprising that the average recent college graduate in the sample of analysis is perceived to have better technical skill compared to the average ACNG.

Employers seem to be favorable to individuals with alternative credentials.
In many cases, employer-perceived skill gaps are not statistically different when comparing recent college gradutes with ACNG candidates.
The relative social preference for the college degree may be better explained by a lack of relevant credentials for some occupations,
government subsidy of the legacy system,
and ignorance about available alternative opportunities on the part of students and those influencing student enrollment choices.

% Notice that the alternatively credentialed individual doesn't need the average employer to value him or her.
% He or she simply needs some significant chance of being hired, and that certainly exists.
% Moreover, the average employer is already favorable to alternative credentials.
% As more alternatively credentialed individuals are highered and promoted through society,
% there is reason to think the number of opportunities afforded to alternatively educated individuals may grow.
% The problem doesn't seem to be about whether alternative credentials work, but whether they exist in a given industrial context,
% and whether an individual would like to pay the college premium for better favorability when both options are feasible.
