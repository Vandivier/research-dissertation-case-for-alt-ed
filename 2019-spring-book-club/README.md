#### 1 - Group Purpose

The text you are reading comes from a README file which exists at: https://github.com/Vandivier/research-dissertation-case-for-alt-ed/tree/master/2019-spring-book-club/README.md

Hi! My name is John Vandivier. I initialized this reading group to benefit my research, but I hope participants benefit as well.

Here's what you might learn in this reading group:
1. How to obtain higher education in a cost-efficient, time-efficient way.
2. How to go about learning new skills, demonstrating mastery, teaching others, and evaluating the knowledge and skill of others.
   1. This includes everything from child learning to professional training and continuous learning.
3. Understand changing processes, technologies, and attitudes with respect to learning in various forms.

Here's what I hope to learn from discussion with other members of this group:
1. Uncover errors, blind spots, and counterarguments.
2. How to optimally communicate my ideas.
3. Expand on ideas through discussion and identification of related literature or data.

Meetings are expected to last between 30 minutes and an hour. Online video call support will be enabled if at least one person has requested to attend this way for that meeting. You can make this request by contacting me at john [at] afterecon.com, or by other means if you know how.

The discussion may involve anything directly related to or indirectly inspired by the reading. You are welcome and encouraged to note other reading material if it adds to the conversation in some way. While the discussion is intended to move broadly, we will kick each meeting off by polling attendees for thoughts to the following standard 3 questions:
1. Does today's material identify any new factors which would impact a return on investment calculation for an individual learner?
2. Does today's material agree with, contradict, or extend any prior discussions or books in an important way?
3. Given that someone read today's material, could we rule out the need to read any prior material as essentially redundant?

I will take notes and make them publically available. Others are encouraged to do the same. You can submit notes in advance of the meeting as well if you would like to contribute to an agenda or conduct an ongoing digital conversation related to the material without needing to actually attend. Here are some ways you can publish your notes:
1. Send them to me and note that you would like them included.
2. Publish them on your own blog or website.
3. File a GitHub issue or pull request against this repository.

I may be able to provide reading text for most or all meetings if requested.

#### 2 - Reading Schedule

Tentatively beginning Feb 9*, the group will discuss one book every two weeks. The books are read chronologically by publication date. Again, you are welcome to join the discussion having read all, some, or none of the assigned material.
