## prior to first meeting

* Earliest note in this group from 11/28/18.
* K asks where are all the critics? I responded that I don't know of any (credible) books opposed to the notion but there are some specific papers critical of, say, online learning and esp MOOCs.
* D points out negative personalities tend to have an external locus of control / identity; possibly we could game a career-advising tool using this, self-similarity bias, attachment bias, or some other trick to get them to 'agree' to a recommended path, esp a top-recommended path.
  * related idea: product-ize this research. similar to idea of using net promoter score; use it to find out if it works (gather research data from real tool users)
