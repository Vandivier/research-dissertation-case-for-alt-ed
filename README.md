# 5. Miscellaneous Notes

1. top econ journals; prefer top 10 https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.journals.all.html

2. read more!!!! in prestigious journals by famous people. pick one, make it highly cited and relevant to other prestigious work (currenter is better). 10 - 20 pages

3. bryan is more optimistic on alternative education for real learning but maybe not for job outcomes (this is where I can maybe be interesting, LATER PAPER TOO ORIGINAL)

4. Portfolio theory and simultaneous operation of a portfolio as 1) a credential/signal, and, 2) an output of productivity and geniune learning/skill evidence (LATER PAPER TOO ORIGINAL)

5. Some directly relevant papers saying 'dearth of data, need new data' (you can cite them, but it's not enough and bordering on too original)

6. site boring papers and try to be a boring paper (add the interesting stuff on low key or later)

7. building on/referencing Caplan's work is a risky move (do it low key or in a later paper)

8. Recommended approach: FIND PAPERS ON RETURNS TO ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION and say "hey I'm just doing another one of these things nbd...low key on low key my man u kno..."

9. Paper 2 is the emphasis: comparing traditional employment outcomes to alternative employment outcomes and then *my* measures of alternative employment outcomes

10. classifiers can be included or ignored - not recommended as seperate economic paper (go ahead an include for now; knock it out of the park)

11. attitudinal survey is currently fit for a think tank, not an academic job; will that change with panel? idk. (maybe a lower quality paper later on)

12. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JE4p_EuWoc
    1. ~20 min define alternative credential as other than 4 year degree
        a. "It's also more than credentials"
        b. points out 'why so diminutive?' and call for language change
    2. ~27 min learner control, portability, verification
        a. what about ratings, institutional reputation, and salary/roi impact?

13. measures of alternativeness? (abnormality or inverse normality)
    1. term obscurity: google ad keyword plan tool (impressions, clicks, etc) or interest on google trends https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/websearch/5NfIpQo3tII
    2. ordinary survey
    3. enrollment
    4. state backing (accredition, loan programs)

14. future research could measure the size of the flexibility remote stigma over time and estimate when it will become negligible; this would be a general measure of market competitiveness bc flexible work is associated with higher productivity, so pure market theory expects rapid convergence but we seem to observe slow convergence; how can we improve convergence speed? https://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/article/a-revolutionary-change-making-the-workplace-more-flexible/

* What does current literature say? alternative credentials and alternative credentials are things which are growing and may represent reduced cost for equal or better learning and signalling. Remaining questions:
    * How fast is alternative education growing? When will alternatively-educated applicants constitute a larger share of applicants than traditionally-educated applicants?
    * Does alternative education tend to equalize or exacerbate inequality? Does it benefit the poor vs the rich evenly or not?
    * Is traditional education good for anyone?
        * The smartest people
        * The high-IQ
        *  The high-grit or those of certain personalities?

    * why are you paying full price for school? because cheap school produce low income; but wait! we already proved high performers perform well regardless, so cheap school low income production seems to be negative signalling, not causal. A smart person should be able to get a cheap degree and not succumb to this low pay tendency
* suppose alt creds are gaining approval over time; does this mean they are efficient? do more-successful-than-average companies tend to be more open to alt creds? do more-successful-than-average companies tend to be more open to remote work? do more-successful-than-average companies tend to be more open to ideas in general? or certain kinds of ideas? what factors create an informationally-open company? can this mindset be trained in or endowed by treatment to some degree? what about simply teaching managers and executives that openness to new ideas can lead to short, mid, and long term profit gains?

* The case against education
    * Somewhere in the book was a data point he said "I didn't think of that" on an alternative, perhaps superior, calculation scheme; perhaps related to tuition and fees? check that out.
    * Chapter 1 Caplan argues people can't go from high school to labor market bc no one would believe their skills; anyone can claim skill; that is, the academic degree is evidence of ability / potential skill; not just actual skill; alternative credentials can substitute in this role and enable high-school-to-labor-market or even better.
        * Caplan allows 33-80%; he's right that it's closer to 80% but he doesn't push it; alternative credentials, apprenticeships, vocational, and other options have better (smaller) signaling ratios
    * Chapter 2, Caplan describes the outright catch 22 of alternative signals of conformity; they signal nonconformity.
        * This would seem to immediately counter alternative credentials
        * But wait! Conformity vs nonconformity is a pseudo-boolean. Really, this is a continuous variable. Online education may be slightly non-conformist, but it's not 0% conformist. Under strict nonconformity, even having attended a private school would be considered nonconformist. Yet, many people learn you went to private school and think more positively of you. Perhaps nonconformity on average has a negative effect, but strategic nonconformity can have a positive effect, and even nonconformity's negative effect may be negligible compared to the gains from nonconformity-based signalling to the signaler (eg I got to skip college, nbd if I'm 5k less salary for a few years).
        * While Caplan's note that anyone can study at Princeton for free is eye-opening, it's also a bit disingenuous. Traveling and living at Princeton is costly in pecuniary and non-pecuniary terms. Many professors actually won't allow an additional student in, or in any case they won't be invited to engage exercises and tests and receive grades and feedback. Grades and feedback are key. They aren't just the material of third party student evaluation, they are also the material of first party student evaluation. That is, feedback facilitates learning by indicating to the learner that they are doing things correctly. Imagine a boxer who could feel no pain. At first this might seem to be an advantage, but it would plausibly ultimately reduce the boxer's incentive to develop specific skills and finesse; mainly those of a defensive type. Alternatively, imagine a boxer who's opponent gives no feedback when receiving a blow. It might indicate to the puncher that his punches make no difference; they are trivial. This could motivate quitting or giving up, as opposed to finishing out a near victory. The same may be even more clear with a sprinter who has the finish line in his sights. The low quality of feedback, or its absence altogether, is a minor note in the case of physically going to Princeton or whatever school. It is dwarfed by the plain economic cost to the would-be student and the reduced expected benefit from uncharitable professors. However, MOOCs represent a certain kind of ironman of Caplan's argument. There are little to no economic costs or unwilling professors with a MOOC. So why do MOOCs perform poorly? One answer is that the feedback mechanism with a MOOC is weak or absent. Also, social networking and individual-level psychological effects may play a role.

* Experience inflation??? only solution would be to start working earlier. How? 1) engage an extended search process for lower req 2) apply anyway 3) substitute for credential (eg take a test to certify skills with recruiter). 4) start with an internship, extracurricular, or something else you can 'argue-as-work' 5) build a portfolio of work 6) freelance work 7) irrelevant prior experience may not be irrelevant; general work ethic and references. Argue components similar (may be more helpful for mid-career switch than new jobs) eg my data analyst to programmer had some overlap with db work and programming as a secondary task.

# 7. Review of The Case Against Education

1 my credentials (studied under caplan, advance review of the book, interest in economics of education, homeschooled and privately schooled in the past)
2 what i liked (and others, not just me)
3 what i didn't like (with suggestions for improvement)  (and others, not just me)

The book presents irrefutable proof of the overinvestment of education in the US as a matter of national policy and in terms average individual expenditure. This is the main aim of the book and it is accomplished in such a manner as to make the claim an uncontroversial fact among economists. With little room in the claim for controversy among economists, it becomes an interdisciplinary focal point. Economists can now credibly posit a generally accepted economist's view on the matter in order to contrast this with interdisciplinary views. Indeed, Caplan has foreseen this discussion and done an unusually effective job at engaging the foreign literatures, something economists of even high calibur rarely do to a degree of rigor which matches the highest levels of quality in the secondary field.

This is not to say the book is flawless. Indeed, the bulk of this review will subsist in pointing out obvious flaws. But I do want to emphasize both the overpowering effectiveness of the book in accomplishing its central mission and also to note the easy reading of the book for both the academic and layperson.

Now, on to the criticisms:
1. Education is defined as years of traditional education. K-12 + college. The education literature itself considers this a decidedly outdated notion of education. Most education scholars would consider something like a certification program to be a mode of education. Many education scholars readily accept evidence-based education as superior to traditional education. Many education scholars would broadly respect informal education, or learning on the job, or self-teaching by perusing YouTube. The modern notion of education advanced by education scholars is rather liberal and embracing of innovative and alternative modes of education, in stark contrast to the outdated convenience notion used in the book.
2. Education policy is ineffective. So what? Does it follow that we should cut education spending or refactor the manner of spending? The book readily concedes larger gains for STEM relative to other forms of education. Yet, the book does not engage seriously with specific actionable policy alternatives. The reader is left with a non-actionable bad taste in their mouth for education spending in general.
3. Neither does the author size up individual-level alternatives. There no discussion of many classic topics in the economics of education such as public vs private K-12 schooling, MOOC and online education vs traditional, charter schools, unschooling, innovative badges, nanodegrees, or gamification, vouchers, and so many others. As one who has surveyed some of the literature, homeschooling is known as a remarkable avenue to academic success with little individual cost. Bryan Caplan has experienced this first hand as he has two sons who have performed remarkably on AP exams despite their young age. These sons were recently readmitted to public school and rapidly withdrawn. Clearly Bryan knows first-hand the advantages of homeschooling vs other modes of precollege education. He has even released a podcast on the issue. Yet, he makes no mention of this important topic in his book.

In the end, Bryan does a great job of proving his thesis and advancing further the already established signaling model, but what actions are available on the basis of his work? I suppose the main policy conclusion is that education spending should be cut, but specific amounts are not discussed and indeed a straightforward cut is not contrasted with all of the many alternatives in how we might spend differently rather than less. Moreover, cuts themselves are ideally strategically implemented rather than poorly suggested as some sort of sector-wide proportional discount. Specific programs to cut and so forth are not engaged. At the individual level Bryan seems not to rock the boat very much, basically telling most people to go for a STEM college degree. To his credit, he deals a blow to the ivy league fiction on the grounds of economic return. Yet, I feel there is room for improvement here. What of all of the education innovations coming around these days? They are not investigated. As a programmer, I want to echo Elon Musk and others who have said that a degree is becoming more and more irrelevant where it can be displaced by cheaper, momre effective evidence-based credentials such as skill-specific certifications. I want to see Caplan take seriously the notion that individuals should be getting to work earlier and learning on the job. I want to see him call for a reduction in the minimal age of working, and I want him to embrace internship as a comparatively effective mode of education.

In another place he says it's neutral value whether existing is good??? in the fertility discussion see lecture 26. Very powerful lecture this is just one reason. But some scientists take reduced female fertility as a gain from education: wtf? economists qua economist should be skeptical of food supply from population boom scares and should be very pro innovation and labor force gains from population; so economist qua economist should be pro population. Then, as a human, Caplan says 'philosophically I think people think existing is good'. more deeply, existence is a necessary precondition for goodness: This is ontological. For good to be good, it must be. Good which is not, is not good. Also as a human, Caplan wrote Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids: Clearly he has thought about this!! Why not rock your shit Caplan? I want to nudge Caplan to be more loudly Caplan. He is clearly being strategic in an attempt to minimize controversy around his book. This is obviously an intelligent move, and I do not recommend he rewrite this addition. I'm simply hoping for a more risk-loving sequel.

WHERE IS THE GRIT? He talks some about personality traits but I would like more please. This compliments the signaling model: You were already awesome because you have grit. Yet, if school can build patience, can it not build perseverance (grit?)

# 8. Non-IT Alt Creds

Do they work as well?
Theory/intuition: No, because employers
also, are soft skills harder to prove? and harder to prove = less effectual alt creds?

Vouchers have mixed results, interesting sources, can feed abm

More data on charters...what data?

Roland Fryer, caplan, hanushek, key dudes. Fryer and SCHMIDTZ lectures on soundcloud...why not youtube? Anyway

Charters not a big step toward markets, but possibly nontrivial he says...so what's the result?? Credo 2009 study. Charter can be montessori, otherwise nonstandard, or unremarkable. What about online charter schools...gale of creative destruction limited by geography.

Seems in private interest to transfer if classes aRe easier.

2009-2013 charter change endogenous to policy, tech, something else? Are they using same hard and soft ware tools?

Ryan cares about econ of edu, does Scott King?

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.edreform.com/2012/03/just-the-faqs-charter-schools/&ved=0ahUKEwi_ydn9mLPaAhVRq1kKHQ51CcMQFgghMAE&usg=AOvVaw12NqYOPpbbNFi8sgX3I_aO

Nationwide, charter schools are paid per student 64% of district counterparts

IQ distribution by geography is roughly equal!!! HiEven poor remote neighborhoods have geniuses by IQ; does this endogenously anticipate a Great Peace when combined with the increasing normalization of remote working and learning? Since income is associated with peace there is reduced incentive for brain drain.

John van...gmu abd...thanks for speaking...2 qs...

Question - does the relation attenuate or grow when adjusted by state or by spending per student? I'm aware charters spend on average 64% of counterparts?

What actionable private lessons can we extract? One is, hey, enroll ur kids in charters. Is there anything else? Are there systematic differences in charter tooling, curricula, or process?

Top-down vs bottom-up measures of success; do standardized scores benefit public schools? What if we use during and post grad earnings, productivity, happiness, and college completion...also SAT vs state-based benchmark.

He doesn't have a causal story but does he gave literature recommendations. Eye contact and personal interaction?. Spiral method??

# 10. Vouchers

Complexity explorer abm.
Voucher process...at least 4 parental strategies. Spend more time and effort with kid, punish kid, reward kid in cash or in kind (interesting is the relief of chores or similar and kids don't care about cash the same way), do nothing.

Parental factors matter...what is their utility of income or income level? What is their prior preference for private v public? Their IQ may reflect an ability to obtain an ideal strategy rather than a convenient, prior biased, or random one.

Kid factors: some kids respond to certain strategies. Eg an emotionally starved kid might prefer time w parent.

External effects...if a parent does all of the homework the kid doesn't learn. If a kid is emotionally starved he or she may not really be learning when spending time w parent.

Establishing the process: open ended survey as a way to define strategies: "would you act differently?"

Tax voucher vs school discount. Homeschooling tax break. Home public teaching as a distinct category allowing state standards.

# 11. Epple et al 2017, School Vouchers

Theoretically the Becker family unit; vouchers directly compensate parents but head-of-household can compensate the student child for the gain the child earns the parent; indirect compensation. Leeson assigned a paper on this on nonmarket decision making.

Would giving a student skin in the game help? Eg cash compensation to student effectiveness vs voucher compensation. Or "in-school money" as a new kind of voucher. A student might, for example, buy school lunches or tickets to athletic events, food at those events, and school themed merchandise with in-school money. In-school money could also pay for extracurricular activities and other field days or items which the school might typically request money from the student in order to participate.

In-school money would be a direct utilitarian mechanism to motivate the student. Similar to cash but limited in uses. The use limitation makes it theoretically comparatively less utility-generating compared to pure cash but potentially better than a voucher.

Vouchers can theoretically result in the child being fully compensated, but practice is another question. Parents might not compensate the child even while they could. Given imperfect compensation in any non-zero degree, direct mechanisms are theoretically better than direct mechanisms.

Yet there is another possibility: Parents can get voucher money and compensate the child using a lesser amount of ordinary cash. Yet, since this cash has a wide array of uses it may be a net-positive transaction for both the child and the parent. For example, many children will value $1500 in cash more than $2000 in school voucher money. The child may be motivated by their parent's contingent promise of $1500 rather than by the $2000. If this process is realistically the case, then models should include parental strategy factors. Those parents preferring this strategy will have effective children while other strategies will be less effective. For example, some parents may not compensate the child at all or they may attempt motivation through a threat of punishment for weak performance.
